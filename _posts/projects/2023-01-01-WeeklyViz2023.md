This is my sixth year of this weekly visualization initiative ;) The goal is to find some fun datasets, visualize them in some fun (or boring) ways, and extract some fun insights.  

Please notice that all the visualizations are designed for desktop view, so it is recommended to view them on a desktop device. You can also find all the vizzes in [my Tableau Gallery](https://public.tableau.com/profile/yu.dong#!/).
