This is my eighth year of this weekly visualization project. I began this journey in 2018 when I started my first full-time job. The goal is to visualize a real-world dataset every week in various creative (or boring) ways and make insights easily visible.  

Please notice that all the visualizations are designed for desktop view, so it is recommended to view them on a desktop device. You can also find all the vizzes in [my Tableau Gallery](https://public.tableau.com/profile/yu.dong#!/).
