### *The Great Bicycle Boom of 2020*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20210104

This week's data is around the bicycle usage boom in 2020. As we looking back 2020, COVID has changed many things, good and bad. One of them is since companies are moving to WFH, and governments promote social distancing, the way of transportations also change accordingly. And it's not surprosing to learn the bicycle usage has increased a lot since COVID starts. You can learn more from the original article [here](https://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/made-on-earth/the-great-bicycle-boom-of-2020.html).  

#### My Visualization

As the first viz of the year, let's do something fancy :) I built a clockwise radar chart to compare the total trial counts between 2019 and 2020, and a bar chart on top with the YoY diff.

#### Insights
* We see a siginificant increase in people cycling and walking at the beginning of COVID (March to April), and the YoY increases in the same period are also significantly higher than other months;  
* COVID seems to have a larger positive imapact on cycling than on walking (makes sense);  
* Generally speaking, we also see more people cycling from April to September (as the weather is nicer).
