### *Nike Factory Locations*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 0903

This week's data is Nike Factories all over the world. You can find the original dashboard [here](http://manufacturingmap.nikeinc.com/). It's very fancy as you can click into the numbers representing the total factories in a certain region to see lower-level factory locations.    


#### My Visualization

My viz this week is a simple map view, with other sheets linked in tooltip, showing the product type composition, factory type composition, and factory location map in the country.

#### Insights
* China has most Nike factories (135 factories with 161k+ workers);  
* Most Nike materials were manufactured in developing countries like China, Brazil and South-eastern Asia countries, as the labor cost is relatively lower; while the North American countries' factories focus more on finished goods;  
* There is no Nike footwear and material factory in the US...
