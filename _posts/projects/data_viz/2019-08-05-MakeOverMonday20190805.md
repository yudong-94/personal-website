### *The power switch: tracking Britain’s record coal-free run*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190805

This week's data is about UK's energy supply by resources over time. It's great to see that coal generated energy has been decreasing over time and UK is on it's longest coal-free run now :) You can find the original article and viz [here](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/may/25/the-power-switch-tracking-britains-record-coal-free-run?utm_term=Autofeed&CMP=twt_gu&utm_medium=&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1558805012).  

#### My Visualization

Tried to show the trend of less coal usage since 2012, while being creative this week... So I turned the 'boring' bar chart into circles with a energy supply comparison in the middle. When you hover on any of the date points in the circles, the inner bar chart will change accordingly.

#### Insights
* Energy demand fulfilled by Coal has been decreasing since 2012 in the UK; 2013 was the worst with around half of the energy generated by coal, but now it's close to coal-free;  
* Historically, we've seen winter seasons have higher percentage of energy supplied by coal -- maybe due to the high overall energy demand during winter seasons.
