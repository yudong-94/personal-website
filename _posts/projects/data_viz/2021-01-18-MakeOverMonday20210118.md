### *Global Temperature 1880-2020*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20210118

This week's topic is one that has popped up multiple times since I started doing makeovermonday - global warming. There are just soo many evidence proving it, showing how human activities have led to it, however, it's really sad that there are still people denying it, or refusing to see its negative impact on human being. I really like the [original viz](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/) today -- it's an interactive website, decomposing the temperature trend since 1880s to multiple potential factors, including orbital changes, solar, volcanic, land use, ozone, aerosols, and finally, greenhouse gases. It provided clear answer that greenhouse gases are a strong driver to global warming.  

#### My Visualization

This week I am using simple scatter plot + moving average lines as the story is very clear even with the simplist viz.

#### Insights
* The temperature fluctuation between 1880 to 1980 is much milder, comparing to 1980 onwards, which is almost linear;  
* The temperature in Northern hemisphere seems lifting much faster than Southern hemisphere -- this makes sense as Northern hemisphere has more land with countries of highest greenhouse gas emission, while water covers more of Southern hemisphere, making temperature change slightly slower.
