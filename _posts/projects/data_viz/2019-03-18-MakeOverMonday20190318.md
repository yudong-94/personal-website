### *How do we really feel about women leaders?*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190318

This week we have a 8 rows and 2 columns dataset on people's attitude towards women leaders. It introduced an concept called [The Reykjavik Index for Leadership](http://www.kantar.com/public/news-events/news/kantar-wpl-reykjavik-index-for-leadership), and compares the index among the G7 nations. The index is out of 100, and higher index means people are more confortable with a female leader. You can find the article [here](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/12/women-reykjavik-index-leadership).  

#### My Visualization

To better visualize the comparison, I made the bar chart looking like a running race, with the location of each athlete representing where the countries are regarding their attitude towards women leaders.

#### Insights
* It's interesting to see that the scores of the top 4 countries are very close, and the bottom 3 are also very close... This could be a cultural thing, and it can be greatly impacted by who is the leader now and how he/she is performing.    
* But still, all the countries have a long way towards equality in this case.
