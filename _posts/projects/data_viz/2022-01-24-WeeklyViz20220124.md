### *China College Entrance Examination Admission*

This week I found a dataset about [China College Entrance Examination Admission](https://www.kaggle.com/g9g99g9g/china-college-entrance-examination-admission) on Kaggle. I have always been told that the college admission rate has gone up a lot over time in China, but never looked at the data closely. It's really suprising to see how both the participation and admission numbers going up.  

#### My Visualization

Here I would like to show three data points -- # of participants, # of admissions, and admission rate. Since there is no way to have three seperate measures in one 'dual axis', I have to make one layered bar charts with the two absolute numbers metrics, and put the admission rate on top as 'floating'.  

*Please notice that all the visualizations are designed for desktop view, so it is recommended to view them on a desktop device.*

#### Insights
* Generally speaking, the admission rate has been on rise from 1977 to 2022, but there are several stages -- the increase from 1977 to 1985 was mainly due to the decrease in participants as the re-started college entrance examnination attracted people from all ages in the first several years; 
* Then after some fluctuation, there was a big jump from ~30% to 50%+ in 1999, due to the university admission expansion policy started that year;  
* Though there was some slowdown around 2007, with the global financial crisis and increase in participants, it climbed up again and reached 90% in 2020.
