### *US Interstate Migration Pattern 2013-2022*

This week I used the dataset from [Makeover Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/). This is a dataset about US interstate and cross-border migration pattern by Atlas Van Lines. It essentially calculates, out of all the moving shipments to/from a state, % that are inbound (moving into the state) vs. % outbound (moving out of the state). You can find their 2022 report [here](https://www.atlasvanlines.com/resources/migration-patterns). This is a very interesting dataset as you can see which states are losing population and the impact of the pandemic.  

#### My Visualization

For my visualization, I only used US interstate data (as I have no idea about these states in Canada...), and to better reflect if a state got net inbound vs. outbound, I created a measure of % inbound / % outbound. Blue bars below represent more inbound than outbound, while yellow bars are the opposite.  

*Please notice that all the visualizations are designed for desktop view, so it is recommended to view them on a desktop device.*

#### Insights
* From 2013 to 2022, the state that has seen a consitantly highest level of inbound movement is North Carolina, while New York, surprisingly, has almost always been the state with highest outbound %, followed by Illinois;  
* As we all know, the pandemic has largely changed the way people live, for example, % people working from home has increased significantly than before the pandemic, and this has caused people leaving some of the most expensive states -- we can see in the chart that California used to have more inbound than outbound movements, but during the pandenmic, there have been more people moving out than moving in;  
* Last but not least, this dataset is from Atlas Van Lines, based on their moving shipments orders data, so it could have some inherient bias on the population choosing their service.
