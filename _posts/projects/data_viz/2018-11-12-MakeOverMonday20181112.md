### *Diversity in Tech*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 1112

This week's dataset is around the diversity data of US tech companies -- include the % of male and female, and % of different ethnicities. I like the [original viz](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/) a lot! It's neat, interactive, and straightforward. It's absolutely a good exmaple of visualization.  


#### My Visualization

This week, I just did something simple -- bar charts to compare the diversity of gender and ethinicity among different tech companies and against US population and US congrass as benchmark.

#### Insights
* US Congress has a super low % of Female compare to the overall US Population distribution -- I would say this is not a good thing;  
* Most tech companies in this dataset have less than half female employees -- typically there are more male engineers than female, though this could just be the result of social sterotype;  
* As of ethnicity diversity, the non-White % in US Congress is also much lower than in the US population...;  
* More than half of the tech companies have better ethinicity diversity -- they have higher proportion of non-white people comparing to US population, though many of the minority employees might not be US citizens.
