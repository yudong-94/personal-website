### *How Much Your Country Spends on Research & Development*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).


### Makeover Monday 0806

This week's topic is the Research and Development Expense by country from 2011 to 2016 -- again as last week, an Economic topic. The original viz could be found [here](https://howmuch.net/articles/research-development-spending-by-country). It's a creative, and straitght-forward viz (the shape looks like a peach).  
I believe just looking at the absolute number will not give much insights, thus I decided to introduced the GDP (PPP in $) data to the dataset. Thanks to the World Bank database for the data.  

#### My Visualization

It's the first time I tried to combine several metrics in different sheets to one table dashboard -- it turned out the most painful part is to make all the sheets align with each other...  
Here is a great [thread](https://community.tableau.com/thread/209591) on how to make this kind of dashboard.

#### Insights
* European countries typically invest higher proportion of GDP in R&D;  
* Though China's GDP has surpassed US, its expense in R&D is still lower than US now (though the expense is also increasing significantly over year).
