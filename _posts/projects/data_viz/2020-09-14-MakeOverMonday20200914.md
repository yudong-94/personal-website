### *School workforce in England*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20200914

This week's dataset is around teachers' pay by gender and level among state-funded schools in England. The dataset comes from the [School Workforce Census](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/school-workforce-in-england#releaseHeadlines-charts), which includes all kinds of information around school workforce in England. This dataset helps us to identify the gender pay gap across different teacher levels in England.   

#### My Visualization

This week I try to keep it simple with the most important information I wanna convey. If you hover on each line, you will also see the actual pay trend between male and female teachers at that level.

#### Insights
* We see an obvious pay gap between male and female teachers at all levels in England;  
* The higher the level is, the larger the gap tends to be;  
* However, we have to admit that there is not conclusive information for us to say that female teachers are not paid fairly -- ideally we need to consider other confounding variables, for example, location (are female teachers more likely to be in those lower play regions), class they teach (maybe there are more female teachers in lower salary disciplines), etc.  
* Besides, it seems like the pay gap among head teachers is getting larger, but ideally we also want to adjust it by inflation.
