### *US Median Earnings by Occupation & Sex*

This month is the Women's History Month, and the last Tuesday (3/8) was the International Women's day. With the spirit of supporting gender equality, this week I am looking at the US median earnings data by occupation and sex from [US Census](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-people.html).  

#### My Visualization

I came across [this post](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/stories/international-womens-day.html#:~:text=Beginning%20in%201910%2C%20March%208,observed%20as%20International%20Women's%20Day.) by cencus.gov celebrating 2020 International Women's day. This is a great resource, and I decided to look at the same two metrics as its first chart -- % women in each occupation and median earnings comparison between men and women. Though the occupation definition seems slightly different as I used the data from [Table P-46A](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-people.html), while the occupation in the post seems more granular.

#### Insights
* Some occupations, for example healthcare support, have way more women (86%) than man, while some occupations like Installation, maintenance, and repair (4%) are mainly men;  
* Though we see this variance of women % across the occupations, there is always an earning gap between women and man (overall 35.8k vs. 49.3k);  
* And there seem to be some correlation between overall earning level and the earning gap -- for occupations that generally earn more, the earning gap between women and men are larger than those lower-pay occupations.
