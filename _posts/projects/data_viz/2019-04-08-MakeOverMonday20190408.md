### *Ranking the States by Fiscal Condition*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190408

This week's data is around state fiscal condition from 2006 to 2016. It contains a lot of different financial metrics -- current asset, current liability, revenue, expense, quick ratio, ... With an bachelor's degree in accounting, these terminology sounds super familiar to me. Though sadly, I cannot remember what do they mean now...  
Also, to measure solvency, this dataset provided five dimensions -- cash solvency, budget solvency, long-run solvency, service-level solvency, and trust fund solvency. You can find the original article [here](https://www.mercatus.org/statefiscalrankings).  

#### My Visualization

I tried to visualize a real 'dashboard' this time :) .

#### Insights
* States like Utah and Florida have been doing fairly well in all the five categories, while states including Kentucky and Connnecticut are doing poorly in most categories;  
* There are also some states have very different performance among the five dimensions -- for exmaple, Arizona ranked 9th in Trust, but 46th in Cash.
