### *Paying the President*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 0910

This week's data is about how much the campaign groups and governmants have paid to President Trump's property. [Here](https://projects.propublica.org/paying-the-president/) is the explanation and visualization of the dataset. The original viz was made by d3.js, but I like it so much that I decided to make a similar one in Tableau.  


#### My Visualization

As mentioned above, my goal this week is to replicate the original visualization as much as I can in Tableau. The time I spent was around 50 minutes.
