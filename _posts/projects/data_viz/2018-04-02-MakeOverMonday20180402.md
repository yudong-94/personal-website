### *World Wine Production*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 0402

This week's dateset is about the wine production by country from 2012 to 2016. We just worked on the Irish Whiskey dataset on Mar 12th and now alcohol again LOL. The original report and data viz could be found [here](http://www.oiv.int/public/medias/5287/oiv-noteconjmars2017-en.pdf).

#### My Visualization

Hmmm yearly data by country again. I have been making bar charts for this type of data every time, so I decided to do something different this time.
Inspired by [this viz](https://public.tableau.com/profile/staticum#!/vizhome/TOPWINEPRODUCERCOUNTRIES2016/Dashboard1) by @staticum posted in the discussion board, I tried to make a similar one. Althrough it's still a bar chart essentially...

#### Insights
* Italy, Spain and France have been the top 3 wine production countries since 2012, and always counted for over half of the world wine production;  
* Europe is definitelly the largest wine production area, but in almost all the continents, you can find some large wine makers.
