### *PCs to Become the Smallest Gaming Platform in 2018*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190826

This week's data is around the game industry revenue by the platform (PC / Mobile / Console). You can find the original viz [here](https://www.statista.com/chart/13789/worldwide-video-game-revenue-forecast/). The story is -- PC became the smallest gaming platform in 2018 with the Mobile gaming revenue keeps surging. I am a heavy console gamer now (on Switch), so I do believe this lol. Please notice that the article was published in 2018, so the data after 2017 are actually projections.  

#### My Visualization

Simple dataset goes best with a simple line chart...

#### Insights
* Based on the projection, revenue on console gaming surpassed that on PC in 2018, making PC the smallest gaming platform;  
* However, you can see the size of neither console gaming and PC gaming can really compare with the mobile gameing since 2016 -- Mobile gaming has been surging since 2012, and the revenue is projected to be 10x in 2020 than that of 2012. This could be explained by the popularity of mobile devices and the development of cross platform games all over the world.
