### *Interests in Pokemon Sleep*

I lately started playing Pokemon Sleep (because they finally started supporting sleep monitoring with Apple Watch). For those who are not familar, Pokemon Sleep is a "sleep-tracking game that rewards the user with Pok√©mon depending on the quality of their sleep" (from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Sleep)). Therefore, I am interested in some statistics about the game. I ended up finding this [survey data on Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1448315/japan-share-of-people-who-want-to-use-pokemon-sleep-by-gender-and-age-group/) with people's intention to use Pokemon Sleep by age and gender in Japan in September 2023. 

#### My Visualization

Instead of showing the full distribution of the % of people with each type of responses, I focused on the % answered "I definitely want to try using it" or "I want to try using it there there is an opportnity for it", and visualize the differences acorss age and gender groups.

#### Insights
* The younger generations clearly have more interests in trying Pokemon Sleep. The interest seem to decreases with age, with the only exception of the age group 30-39 -- they have higher interests than respondents aged 20-29, potentially because they were the first generation that grew up with Pokemon and had strong affection with it;
* In the 15-19 years old age group, women and men show similar level of interests. But for respondents between 20 and 59, it is interesting that women consistently show higher interests than men. Maybe this is because Pokemon Sleep is a gamified sleep tracking game (not a real competitive game), and this type of game is more attractive to women.
