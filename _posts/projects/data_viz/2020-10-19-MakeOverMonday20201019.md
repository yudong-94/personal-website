### *US Health Spending*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20201019

This week, we are looking at the health spending across the world since 1970. The original data can be found [here](https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm) and I honestly really like the viz tool as it allows you to explore different measures, time ranges, and highlight specific countries. Also the visualization is very neat and straightforward.  

#### My Visualization

Though this dataset has data across the world, I am only focusing on US this time as there is some very interesting pattern in the US data...

#### Insights
* Overall, US health spending (measured as % of GDP) has been trending up since 1970, from 6% to 17%;  
* When breakding down by spending types, we can see a significant increase in compulsory health spending since 2014, couples with a significant decrease in voluntary health spending. And this correspond with the time that the Obamacare is introduced -- I am not super familiar with this act, but after some research, this seems to be the most likely reason behind this sudden change.
