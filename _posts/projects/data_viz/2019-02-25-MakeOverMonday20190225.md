### *Economic value of the bicycle industry*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190225

This week, the dataset is very simple -- it shows from 2011 to 2016, how many bikes were imported into the UK, and how many of them were e-bikes, how many were manual bikes. You can find a detailed report [here](http://www.sqw.co.uk/files/6914/9406/9034/SQW_Economic_value_of_the_bicycle_industry_and_cycling_March_2017_FINAL.pdf).  

#### My Visualization

Simple data, simple story this week. (This is the first time that I tried a dark background :))

#### Insights
* We see the proportion of e-bikes out of all the imported bikes overall has been increasing from 2012 to 2016, and the spike was in 2015 Q4, in which e-bikes counted for 12% of all imported bikes;  
* However, regarding the total number of imported bikes, we see it's declining over time -- This could be good if the bikes produced and sold in the UK were increasing, or it could indicate the total market is shrinking;
