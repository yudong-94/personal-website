### *Game of Thrones Deaths*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190701

This week's dataset is pretty interesting -- it's about the deaths in Game of Thrones. Though I am not a big fan of GoT, it's definitely a hot topic in social media and even in the office. So not suprisingly, people will do visualization of it. You can find the original post [here](https://datasaurus-rex.com/gallery/gotviz-mkiii).  

#### My Visualization

My visualization this week tries to visualize the dataset from the perspective of 'the most dangerous locations in GoT', i.e. if somehow you went into the world of GoT, the locations you should avoid :)

#### Insights
* King's Landing is definitely one spot you should avoid if you ran into the world of GoT -- it has been the top dangerous location (measured by the deathes) in four of the eight seasons, and especially in the last season with a record high death number of 845;  
* Daenerys ranked at the top killer with 1008 death that far surpassed any of her competitors.. This is related to the 772 deaths she caused in the last season in King's Landing...
