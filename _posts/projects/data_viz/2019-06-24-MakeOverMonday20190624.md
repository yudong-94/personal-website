### *Alcohol Consumption By Country*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190624

This week's data is the top 25 countries by their alcohol consumption per capita. Not surprisingly, most of the top countries are from East Europe and, of course, Russia. You can find the original viz and article [here](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/who-drinks-the-most-alcohol-consumption-by-country.html).  

#### My Visualization

I was trying to visualize the alcohol consumption by showing different 'water level' in a wine bottle for each country, but sadly that's not really achievable within one hour, so instead, I put a wine bottle shape on top of the bar chart -- so it becomes the diffferent shapes of the wine bottles now lol.

#### Insights
* Within the top 25 countries, most of them are Europe countries (and Russia), with the exception of South Korea (ranked at 17, suprising to me) and Australia (19).
