### *Americans touch their smartphones 2,617 times a day*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190819

This week's data tells us how Americans are obbessed with smartphones... [The original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/09/cal-newport-a-digital-declutter-can-help-you-reduce-smartphone-time.html) starts with a very shocking title -- Americans touch their smartphones 2,617 times a day. And in the visualization, it shows over half of the parents and teens claiming that they at least sometimes check phone for message as soon as waking up, and feel their parent/teen distracted by their phone during in-person conversation.   

#### My Visualization

I like the original viz as it's clear and straitforward with good color coding. Therefore, I am reproducing it with some more visual attractive elements (like smartphones!)... Btw, it's the first time I try the transparent floating object, and it works great! (Though moving all the objects around and adjusting the position is a pain...)

#### Insights
* Parents are more likely to be distracted by phone during work/class/in-person conversation than teens (at least the survey says so...);  
* However, significantly more teens claim they would check phone for messages as soon as waking up (probably parents just don't want to see those work-related messages lol).
