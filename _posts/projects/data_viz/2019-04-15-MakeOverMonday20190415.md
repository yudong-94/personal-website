### *The words in ‘Info We Trust’*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190415

This week's data is about the word frequency of the book 'Info We Trust' by RJ Andrew. This is the second time I see text data in makeovermonday, and the original viz itself is a word cloud, which is almost everyone's instinct facing a vasiualization problem of text data. But also as many of you know, word cloud has its own problem of not quantitative enough and not straitghtforward to compare among the words.  

#### My Visualization

With that being said, of course, I cannot make a word cloud this time... Instead, I made a bump chart style viz to see how the top words chaging in each section of the book.

#### Insights
* 'data' has always been among the top 5 words in all the sections (atually it's the top 1 in four out of six sections) -- information with data definitely seems more trustworthy;  
* Not surprisingly, we see some top words very much related to the topic of the section -- 'number' in mathemagical, color in metaphorical, ...
