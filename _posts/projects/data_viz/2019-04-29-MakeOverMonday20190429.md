### *ISS Spacewalks*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190429

This week's data is about spacewalking at the International Space Station (ISS) from NASA. The original artical and viz can be found [here](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/spacewalks/). The original viz compares the spacewalks in US/Russia spacesuits from 1998 up to now, as these two countries have played most important roles in the development of space research and technology. I like the background image of the viz :)  

#### My Visualization

This week, I ended up with simple bar chart (and cute icons!). I noticed the overall spacewalk trend in the original viz -- peaked around 2007 and decreasing since then. I am curious does this trend holds true with # of spacewalkers as well.

#### Insights
* We can see two peaks of the unique spacewalkers in a year -- one around 2001, and another around 2008. This is very similar to what we see of the spacewalk counts trend.  
* Since 2008, in 10 years, we see much fewer spacewalkers -- potentially because of the effect of the financial crsis (the space costs might be cut since then).
