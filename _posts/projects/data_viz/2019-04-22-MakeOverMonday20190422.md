### *Steph Curry’s Stadium Popcorn Rankings*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190422

This week's data is super interesting -- how a top NBA player (Stephen Curry) will rank all the NBA Arena by... the popcorn they offered? lol . The ranking has five dimensions each with a given score from 1 to 5 -- freshness, saltness, crunchiness, butter, and presentation. Sadly none of the Arena got 25 points, but American Airlines Center of Dallas Mavericks did get 24/25, with only 1 point lost at crunchiness.  
The original viz (you can find [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/12/sports/basketball/stephen-curry-warriors-popcorn.html)) is a simple heatmap, which definitely works.  

#### My Visualization

To better compare across the areans (and make the plot a little bit fancier), I made a radial stacked bar chart. [Last time](https://yudong-94.github.io/personal-website/projects/data%20viz/MakeOverMonday20181119) I followed [a very detailed tutorial](https://ryankrowland.wordpress.com/2016/10/20/radial-stacked-bar-charts-in-tableau/) to make it, but this time, just to polish my skill and strengthen my understanding, I did not look at the instruciton, but start from preparing the data myself. This reminds me of working with Analytic geometry in the Cartesian coordinate system in high school...

#### Insights
* The popcorn at American Airlines Center of Dallas Mavericks get 24/25, with only 1 point lost at crunchiness;  
* Oracel Arena of Golden State Warriors only got 19/25, and seems like it really needs to provide fresher popcorn, as anyway it's arena that Stephen Curry should have played at most.
