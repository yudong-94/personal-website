### *Toughest Sport by Skill*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 0507

This week's topic is the skills difficulty level of different sports. It's interesting to see that some sports require high skills across all the fields, while some are rather easy to get started.
And the original viz could be found [here](http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/sportSkills). This is essentially a table...  


#### My Visualization

As the dataset has multi-dimensional scores for each sport, I think it's interesting to try Radar Chart this time. I spent around one hour and a half to finish my dashboard.  
It's kind of tricky to make a Radar Chart in Tableau, as you have to convert the (x,y) coordinates yourself first. And I followed [this tutorial](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2015/7/use-radar-charts-compare-dimensions-over-several-metrics-41592) to make the Radar Chart.
Another tricky point is to display the reference lines (although this is not neccessary, but surely good to have). I did that by adding a helper 'sport' with all scores of 10, and an original point with all scores of 0, and plot a line chart between them.
Below is my dashboard.

#### Insights
* Boxing is one of those sports that require high-level skills in almost all fields.  
* Some examples of sports require exceptionally good skill in one field is sprints, gymnastics, and auto racing.  
* Based on the level of skills required, fishing could be the most relaxing sport.
