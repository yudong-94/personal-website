### *Historical NBA Team Spending Against the Cap*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).


### Makeover Monday 0716

This week's topic is about NBA Player Salary since the Season 1990-1991. It includes the salary of each player on each team in each season.  
You can find the original viz [here](https://www.whatsthecap.com/nba/salary-cap/). The basic idea is that, the salary cap has been increasing, but meanwhile, average payroll has always been above the cap.   

#### My Visualization

I made a very simple viz of scatter plots with a trendline showing how the median team salary has been increasing. Also, when you hover on the data points, you will see the team info, and the top 5 highest-salary players on that team in that season. Btw, I am not a big NBA fan, so I do not include the cap info, as I am not sure what it actualy means...
