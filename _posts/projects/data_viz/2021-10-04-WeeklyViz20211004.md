### *Pfizer Stock Performance During Covid*


Today, when I log into [MakeoverMonday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) as always, I smelled something different, as there is no dataset posted for this week. Then after some Twitter search, I realized last week was not only the 300th makeovermonday, but the last one before its [indefinite hiatus](https://twitter.com/VizWizBI/status/1442408060450865158). I feel so sad :( I started my MakeoverMonday back in 2018 Jan, when I just started my career at Ancestry, and after 196 weeks, it has been part of my life, my Monday routine. But I totally understand how much effort running such a project involves, and truly appreciate everyone that made this happen.  
With that being said, I decide to keep this weekly habit, and find my own dataset going forward. We will see how long I can persist :)  
  
This week, I opened Kaggle (after such a long time). And while scrolling down the homepage, the [Pfizer stock price dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/varpit94/pfizer-stock-data) caught my eye. So I made a visualization on this dataset to see whether PFE stock price benefits from COVID.  

#### My Visualization

I added S&P 500 index closing price as a benchmark to better understand PFE's performance against the market.

#### Insights
* When the market dived in March 2020, we saw a similar dip for PFE. However, PFE was not able to catch up with the crazy S&P 500 uptrend last year;  
* We can see two clear spikes of PFE in the past 12 months -- once in 2020 Dec with FDA issued EUA for Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine, and another one in 2021 Aug with FDA's official approval of the Vaccine.
