### *Rhino Poaching in South Africa*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190513

This week's data is around the Rhino poaching in South Africa. The original article and viz cound be found [here](https://lowvelder.co.za/376918/antipoaching-figures-look-better-still-losing-three-rhinos-day/). And a more detailed report on Rhino poaching could be found [here](http://www.poachingfacts.com/poaching-statistics/rhino-poaching-statistics/). Rhino populated on Africa and Asia, but sadly because of people demanding their horns for show-off or whatever crazy reason, their population has been decreasing. To my point, killing an animal not for survival purpose and even making then endangered is terrible.  

#### My Visualization

Regarding the visualization, I do like the original viz, though there are two slight problems I think: 1. since the viz use one Rhino icon to represent 50 poaching, they somehow make 36 and 13 look the same, which could be a little bit confusiong; and 2. I think poaching is a illegal and unethical thing, so maybe green is not a good color for it...

#### Insights
* The number of poaching has been increasing dramastically since 2009, and seems like having reached peak at around 1.2k per year in 2014;  
* However, this does not neccessarily mean that the situation is getting better - it could be that the overall population of Rhino has decreased too much.
