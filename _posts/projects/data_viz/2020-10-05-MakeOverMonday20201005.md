### *The U.S. Counties With the Highest Economic Output*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20201005

This week's dataset is US 2018 GDP by counties. The [original article](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/3d-map-the-u-s-cities-with-the-highest-economic-output/) uses 3D bar plot on top of map views to show the metros with highest economic output measured by GDP in 2018. The NY Metro has the highest GDP and it's way ahead of other metros. Though as I am curretly in the Bay Area, I want to say that in CA we have two large metros (SF and LA) and several other high-GDP counties, so CA state total is still the highest lol.   

#### My Visualization

Well, not getting much inspiration today, so let's do a map + list, with set actions on map hovering.

#### Insights
* County-wise, LA county shows up as the one with highest GDP. However, please notice that counties have different sizes and populations. LA county is actually also the one most populated in the US (could be a correlation or causation)...   
* Most large dots on the maps (the counties with higher GDP) are along the coast, with much lower GDPs in middle (especially middle west) US.
