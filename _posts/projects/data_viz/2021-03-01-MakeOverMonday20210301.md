### *Seats Held by Women in National Parliaments*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20210301

This week we are looking at the percentage of seats held by women in national parliaments in the Europe. I feel this is one topic that has been surfaced multiple times since I started participating in MakeoverMonday, but of course, it's never too much. This data is from [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/sdg_05_50/default/table?lang=en). It's great to see that overall EU percentage has been continuously up.

#### Insights
* Overall in EU, from 2013 to 2019, the percentage of seats held by women in namtional parliaments has been increasing steadily from 20% to 32%;    
* Generally speaking, we see North European countries leading the race (as we see in many other stats measuring gender equality), and we see the percentage increasing much faster in other European countries as they are catching up.
