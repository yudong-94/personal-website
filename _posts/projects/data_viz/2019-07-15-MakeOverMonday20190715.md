### *The share of Americans not having sex has reached a record high*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190715

This week's data is super interesting lol. It's about the sex frequency of the Americans. Surprisingly, the share of Americans not having sex in the past year has reached record high. And [this article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/29/share-americans-not-having-sex-has-reached-record-high/?utm_term=.d77d9861a3dc) disccused the reason behind it in great details. Seems like it's a combination of aging society, cultural factors, and the modern technology.     

#### My Visualization

My viz targets to convey the change in a clear and simple manner, with an stacked area chart on top with aggregated response groups, and three detailed trendline at the bottom.  
Also, please notice that I removed all the Not Application / No Answer / Don't know responses, so the number is a little bit different from the original article.

#### Insights
* Americans with high sex frequency (more than weekly) keeps decreasing since 1990. The percentage said they did not have any sex reached a record high of 27% in 2018;  
* You can see a weird spike of people having sex in 2012, not sure what happend (maybe data issue), but could be somehow related to the end of world rumour lol.
