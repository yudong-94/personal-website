### *Female Teachers Percentage*

This week I browsed datasets in Kaggle and came across this [Percentage of female teachers dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carloscll/percentage-of-female-teachers-unesco) from UNESCO. It shows the female teachers percentage across the world by country and education level, from 2017 to 2021. I have always had the impression that there are way more female teachers, especially in primary and secondary educations, so it would be interesting to explore this data and validate the assumption. This month is also the Women's History Month, so I feel this is the perfect dataset for this week.  

#### My Visualization

The visualization is a scatter plot with each dot representing one country at each education level. You can hover on the dots to change the country being highlighted.  

*Please notice that all the visualizations are designed for desktop view, so it is recommended to view them on a desktop device.*

#### Insights
* Generally speaking, we see higher percentage of female teachers in lower education level instituitions;
* At pre-primary education, the median percentage is as high as 97%; and for primary education, it is at 80%;
* However, when it comes to the [tertiary education](https://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/tertiary-education-isced-levels-5-8), the median falls to 46%, lower than half;
* This decrease in female teachers % could be correlated to the gender inequality in education in some countries and some sterotype of female being more patient and better teacher for younger kids. But of course, this is a complex social issue and has many factors behind it.
