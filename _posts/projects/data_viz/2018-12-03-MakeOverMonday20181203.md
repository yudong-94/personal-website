### *Women Constructors in the Shortz Era*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 1203

This week's data is about the women constructors in the Shortz Era. Shortz Era is the main editor of the Xword games on the NY Times. For every game, it has many collabotrators. And this data tells on each year, each weekday, how many of the games has women 'constructors' or not.  
Btw, I enjoy the Xword games a lot, though in Chinese... Really cannot do English Xwork games :(

#### My Visualization

This week I used the Xwork game color palette, and created a simple heatmap.

#### Insights
* It seems like women are less likely to work as 'constructors' for the game on Friday and Saturday;  
* Over year, we are seeing higher percentage of games with male 'constructors' only.
