### *Breakfast Cereals: Healthy or Unhealthy?*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20200907

This week we are working on a dataset with nutrition facts of different breakfast cereal products. As stated in [this article](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/are-breakfast-cereals-healthy), it's interesting that cereal is considered as one of those healthy food, yet it really depends on the brand and products -- some could be high sugar and carb as well.  

#### My Visualization

To help people the cereal based on their nutrition preference, I built this dash with five nutrition filters. When you click on one of the product meeting the selection criteria, you will see its detailed nutrition facts table on the right.

#### Insights
* It's interesting that calories per serving could vary from 50 to 160, similarly, sugar could vary from 0g to 15g per serving (but obviously, serving size is another variable here);  
* Generally speaking, high sugar is correlated with high calorie.
