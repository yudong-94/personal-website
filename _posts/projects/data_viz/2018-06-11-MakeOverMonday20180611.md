### *Tourism Density Index*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 0611

This week's topic is the tourism density index. The dataset gives the info of top 10 over-tourism and under-tourism countries, including their number of locals, number of tourists, and rank.  
As the tourism density index is simply defined as # of tourists / # of locals, it's not surprising to see China on the top 10 list of under-torism :)  


#### My Visualization

I am really struggling a lot with maps..... Tried for more than one hours, but still turned out with a simple map. Not sure what is the better way to visualize this type of geo data.

#### Insights
* Most of the top 10 over-tourism countries are in Europe. Some of them are here just because the country itself is too small (for example, Singapore)...  
* Most of the top 10 under-tourism countries are relatively large (like China), or population-intensive (like African countries).
