### *US Licensed Drivers 1983 vs. 2017*

I am taking driver lessons right now in order to get my driver's license. Though I've been to the US for more than five years now, I am too lazy to get one. And honestly, living in LA then Bay Area, I am just not motivated enough... This makes me wonder, when do American normally get their driver's license. The exact data was a bit hard to find online, but I found this [Statista chart](https://www.statista.com/chart/18682/percentage-of-the-us-population-holding-a-drivers-license-by-age-group/), and it leads me to [this website](https://www.greencarcongress.com/2019/02/20190202-sivak.html) with % licensed drivers in the US by age groups in different years. And it is interesting to look at how the driver's license popularity has changed in the past 40 years.  

#### My Visualization

I focused on the earliest and most recent years available in the dataset -- 1983 and 2017, and drew a gantt plot to compare the licensed driver % by age buckets.

#### Insights
* Comparing 1983 and 2017, it seems people are getting their driver's licenses later in life;  
* The difference is larger in younger age groups but becomes much smaller if you compare the % licensed drivers for people over 30 years old;  
* This could be due to more and more strict rules for younger drivers and the increased availability of rideshare apps;  
* Overall, more than half of the American already have their driver's license at the age of 18.
