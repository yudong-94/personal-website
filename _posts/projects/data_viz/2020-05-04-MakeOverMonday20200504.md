### *Obstetric Fistula in Madagascar*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20200504

This week's data is about Obstetric Fistula in Madagascar. This is a very heavy topic, and looking at the data, I feel even more painful and sad. Giving birth has been a very dangerous thing as a woman, especially for those living in not that developed areas. I hope that one day world can be kinder to them.  

#### My Visualization

This is the first time I have tried to create a long information chart.

#### Insights
* On average, the years lost with fistula is 2.5 years, and with a surgury, the average years gained is as long as 10.8 years!  
* Over 80% of the fistula cases happened due to obstructed labor;  
* Women with fistula typically had very early first pregnancy time, and low education level (though we may want to compare with country average to see are they yonger / lower education then those who did not suffer from fistula);  
* Over half of the labor with fistula is longer than 2 days -- I cannot imagine how painful it would be...  
* And as the result of fistula, almost all the women would suffer from leaking urine, and most likely it would be a still birth...
