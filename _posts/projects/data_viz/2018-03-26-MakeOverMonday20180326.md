### *Top 10 Popular Chocolate Bar Brands in the UK*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 0326

This week's topic is about popular chocolate bar brands in the UK （¯﹃¯）. The data is the survey result of the top 10 popular chocolate bar brands for three different age groups in the UK. You can find the complete vizzes and report [here](https://www.cda.eu/blog/uks-favourite-chocolate-bar/).
I have also attached the vizzes at the end of this article (It's very long, so I decided not to put it here before my dashboard :)).

#### My Visualization

This time I complete the dashbord in only 50 minutes! Yayyyy!  
Visualizing ranking among different groups is not something I am very experienced at, therefore, I decided to start from replicating the original visualization.  
I followed a detailed instruction on creating **bump charts** [here](http://www.sirvizalot.com/2016/03/color-popularity-for-new-cars-2000-2015.html). Based on this, I also added some labels and created a small chart of top 3 winner brands.

#### Insights
* Some brands are popular among all the age groups, and the top three are Mars, Galaxy and Snickers.  
* There are some brands that perform better in certain age groups (niche market players). For example, younger British likes Dairy Milk a lot more than the elder (65+); Bouty and Picnic only appear on the top 10 list of 65+ British.
