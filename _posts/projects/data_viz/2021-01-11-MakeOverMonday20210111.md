### *Viz5: Gender Inequality in HIV Infections in Adolescents*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20210111

This is the first #viz5 of 2021 -- this time we are looking at the gender inequality in HIV infections in Adolescents (age 10-19) in Africa, with the measures of incidence rate per 1,000 population, deaths per 100,000 population, and population living with AIDS. We all know AIDS is a huge problem in Africa today, but I did not realize it's impacting young female so much more than male there.  

#### My Visualization

To easily compare the metrics across the countries and showing the trend over time, I chose the grid layout with a small map at the bottom right.

#### Insights
* We see huge spike in incident rate per 1000 uninfected population in late 90s in countries including Eswatini, Lesotho, South Africa, Zimbabwe, etc;  
* And there is also a spike in death rate per 100000 population in early 2000s potentially due to the infection spike in late 90s;  
* We are also seeing in many African countries, generally speaking, number of people living with AIDS has been increasing -- this basically means new infection is greater than death each year, and is a result of the accumulative infections, also could potentially be due to better treatment and lower death rate.
