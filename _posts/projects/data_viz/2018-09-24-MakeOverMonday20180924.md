### *Visualzing Equality*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 0924

This week, we are working on the same topic as the week [0305](https://yudong-94.github.io/personal-website/projects/data%20viz/MakeOverMonday20180305) -- gender equality. This is definitely an important topic nowadays that worth a lot of exploration and analysis. And I believe making visualization is also a great way to attract more attention to this topic.  
The dataset is a survey data, asking people what they think are the top three priorities regarding improving gender equality. The original viz and report could be found [here](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2018w39-visualizing-equality/workspace/file?filename=Insert_AdvocatesSurvey_EM2030.pdf).  


#### My Visualization

I spent around one hour to visualize the data with the purpose to compare people's priorities acorss geo and gender.

#### Insights
* Across all the geo, people all agree that the top priority today in relation to gender equality is 'Reducing gender-based violence';  
* Africa is the only region that put 'Economic empowerment, access to land and financial inclusion' as the second priority, reflecting the current poor gender equality situation in Africa;  
* Meanwhile, the other regions except North American and Europe put 'Sexual and productive health and rights' as the second priority, and North American and Europe puts 'Women and work, unpaid care, pay gap' as the second priority, potentially indicating that in this region, securing the basic needs and rights for women has been pretty much done, and people are now focusing more on gender equality in worklife;  
* Comparing the responses from respondents with different genders, Male and Female both agree on 'Reducing gender-based voilence' as the top priority, while the ones identified themselve as 'In another way' put 'Women's political and civil society participation' at the top priority.
