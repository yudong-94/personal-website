### *The Winter Olympics*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 0212

This week's data is about the Winter Olympic Winners. The original dashboard could be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/TheWinterOlympics/TheWinterOlympics?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no).  
This is a very nice dashboard, as it has clear filters, friendly instructions and easy-to-understand viz. Users can play with the filters themselves to explore insights.

#### My Visualization

I decided to explore the dataset from a different point of view: explore the age distribution of those Winter Olympics Medal Winners.
I spent around 2 hours on this.  
Below is my dashboard. You can play with all the filters, and even choose your own age to see, where is your age in the distribution - is it higher than the median, or even higher than most of the winners.
Although you may be upset that most of the Olympics Medal Winners are actually much younger than you :)  
By the way, I don't like the boxplot in Tableau very much, as it is very restrictive - you can not even edit the tooltip of the box...

#### Insights
* Overall, the median age of medal winners has decreased since 1924 (27.5), and reached minimum in 1984 (23), then increased a little bit;  
* The median age of silver medal winners is a little bit higher than gold and bronze medal winners;  
* Among all the sports, the median age of medal winners of Figure Skating is the lowest - only 22.5, while those of Cross-country skiing and Skeleton are the highest - 29;  
* The age range of medal winners of some sports, for example, Freestyle Skiing and Nordic Combined, is narrower than the others - different sports have different optimal age to play, and some are less restrictive on ages;  
* Althrough Olympics is for the younger athletes (some players won medal as young as 14), there are players of 42 winning medals - very inspiring!
