### *On Which Platforms Have You Begun or Completed Data Science Courses*


This week, let's continue exploring the [2021 Kaggle ML&DS Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2021/data). The two dimensions we look at this week are degree and learning platform (from the question 'On which platforms have you begun or completed data science courses'). It is pretty interesting to look at the platforms preferences among data science professionals/learners in different degrees.   

#### My Visualization

Degree can be viewed as a 'ordinal categorical variable', so I used line chart to plot how the % of people used a certain platform across the degree axis.

#### Insights
* First of all, I would like to call out that since this survey is conducted by Kaggle facing Kaggle users, the result could be biased more towards 'Kaggle Courses';  
* Coursera is overall the most popular platform to learn data science (I also started with Coursera), and it is very interesting that there seems to be a positive correlation between degree and coursera usage % -- maybe it's because Coursera is a great collection of courses taught by top-tier schools, and people who spent longer time in school tend to accept this form of learning experience better;  
* Platforms following Coursera are Kaggle and Udemy. We don't see much popularity differences of Kaggle among different degrees, again, partly could be due to the fact that this is a survey ran by Kaggle. But I agree that the best way to learn is by practicing, and Kaggle is probably the platform that combines learning and practicing best;  
* Udemy popularity trend is interesting as it first goes up with degree, and reached highest popularity among people with master's degree, then goes down. Comparing Udemy with Coursera, my understanding is that Udemy offers higher variaty of courses but generally speaking shorter in length and lower quality, and that might explain why it is not that popular among people with PhD or professional doctora;  
* It's also interesting that cloud-certification (AWS, Azure, etc.) is the least selected options -- I personally think you don't really need any certificate to enter this industry.
