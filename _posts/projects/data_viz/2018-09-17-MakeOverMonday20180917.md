### *Train Versus Plane in Europe*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 0917

This week, the dataset about the cost of taking train vs. plane in Europe. Regarding cost, it does not only consider money cost, but also environmental cost (carbon emission) and time cost. The original article and viz could be found [here](https://www.dw.com/en/trains-vs-planes-whats-the-real-cost-of-travel/a-45209552). The vizzes are quite simple and straightforward. Inspired by the last chart - radar plot of differnt routes, I decided to do something similar in Tableau.  


#### My Visualization

It's great to have a chance to practice Radar Chart again. And I have to admit that this chart that I spent around 90 mins to make, is not as visually attractive and intuitive as the original one :(  
One reason is that annotating the axis in Radar Chart in Tableau appear to be hard, another reason is the failure of choosing the visualization strategy (the use of color, icon, ...).  

Also, please notice that the travel time here for plane, is the flight time + 3 hour's travel/waiting time in airport.

#### Insights
* Train always has strong advantage in EcoPassengerCO2;  
* Comparing ticket price and travel time, it's Plane does not appear to be a strong winner;  
* Consider all the info above, I would definitely recommend people taking train instead of plane in Europe.
