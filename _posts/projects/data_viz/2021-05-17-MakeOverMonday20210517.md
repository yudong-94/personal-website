### *What Animal Could You Beat in a Fight?*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20210517

This week we have a fun dataset -- What animal could you beat in a fight? It's the survey data from YouGov, asking people if they thought they could triumph in battle against an animal without weaponry. You can find the survey details and visualizations [here](https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2021/05/13/lions-and-tigers-and-bears-what-animal-would-win-f).

#### Insights
* Male overall are more confident than Female in beating most types of animals, but this difference gets much closer when facing the strongest animals (elephant, crocodile, and grizzly bear) as below 10% people think they could win for both gender;  
* Most gender differences are seen among the survey results against medium power animals -- for goose and medium-sized dog, 20% more men are confident in beating it than women; and for eagle, large dog, and king cobora, the difference is 15%.
