### *SF Sunrise & Sunset Time With Daylight Saving*

On 3/13, the Daylight Saving Time started again, and we lost one hour... I was staying up late playing games and at 2 AM, it became 3 AM. This is no fun (and makes me feel guilty). As a result, on the following Monday, I feel so tired when I got up at the time I usually get up. The US has been switching clocks twice a year for almost 50 years now. But on 3/15, The U.S. Senate on Tuesday passed legislation that would make daylight saving time permanent starting in 2023, ending the twice-annual changing of clocks in a move promoted by supporters advocating brighter afternoons and more economic activity. The House of Representatives, which has held a committee hearing on the matter, must still pass the bill before it can go to President Joe Biden to sign. You can find more details in [this news](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-approves-bill-that-would-make-daylight-savings-time-permanent-2023-2022-03-15/).  
So this week, I am visualizing the sunrise and sunset time year around with daylight saving and how it has shifted our schedule.  

#### My Visualization

The visualization itself is pretty simple -- It's a gantt plot with sunrise time at y axis, and length of the bar indicating the daylight hours.  

*Please notice that all the visualizations are designed for desktop view, so it is recommended to view them on a desktop device.*

#### Insights
* Daylight Saving Time lasts for ~ 8 months, which is actually twice long as the Standard Time;  
* Because of Daylight Saving, the latest sunset time is seen in late Jun at around 8:35 PM -- I absolutely feel it gets dark much later since Daylight Saving starts;  
* If we go permenant Daylight Saving, we will no longer see subset earlier than 5 PM (earliest 5:50 in Nov), but sunrise could be after 8 AM in the winter.
