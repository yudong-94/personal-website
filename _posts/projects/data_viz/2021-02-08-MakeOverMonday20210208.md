### *Viz5: Perceived Obstacles to Gender Equality*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20210208

This is another week of #Viz5. The dataset is very fasinating -- perceived obstacles to gender quality. The researchers surveyed people from 17 countries asking 'thinking about the reasons below, which, if any, do you personally think are the main reasons why women might not be equal to men in your country?' (the reasons can be found below in the dashboard). Comparing responses from different countries and between male and female, we can see lots of interesting things :)

#### Insights
* First of all, as this data points are perceptions, a low percentage could be 1. this is not a widely exsiting issue; or 2. people do not realize this is a problem even if it exists;  
* Generally speaking, the reasons most respondents agree on is 'Because unpaid care, domestic work, and parental responsibilities are not shared equally between women and men', and in all countries, female respondents are more likely to believe it's a problem by a large percentage (~10%);  
* But for many reasons, different countries and female and male have very different variance;  
* Different from what I thought, looking at the different regions, actually respondents from countries in the same region could have very different opionions (except New Zealand and Australia);  
* Looking at China specifically, one thing very interesting is that the responses difference between male and female are relatively smaller comparing to most other countries.
