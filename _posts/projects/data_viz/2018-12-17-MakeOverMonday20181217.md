### *London Bus Safety Performance*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 1217

The week's dataset is about the London Bus Injuries since 2015 to 2018 Q2. Each record in the table is one injury record from a London Bus incident, and it has the info of borough, group of the bus, incident type, victim type, and incident result type, etc. The original dashboard could be found [here](http://content.tfl.gov.uk/q2-18-london-bus-safety-dashboard.pdf). Well... It's not really a dashboard, but a PDF report with default Excel charts :)  

#### My Visualization

I spent around one hour to make a Tableau dashboard. It shows the Quarterly injuries trend, QoQ%, YoY%, incident type distribution, and incident result type distribution. You can also filter on certain bus groups.
