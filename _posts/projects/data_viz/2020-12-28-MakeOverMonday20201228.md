### *Global Import of Cocoa Beans 2015-2019*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20201228

Yay! Here marks another fantastic year with MakeoverMonday!!! This week we are looking at something sweet, and perfect for the holiday season -- chocolate. Oh wait, actually the global import of cocoa beans :). The data comes from [this very comprehensive report](https://www.cbi.eu/market-information/cocoa/trade-statistics#) on cocoa demand in the Europe. I have to admit I did not read the whole thing.. But if you love chocolate and want to learn more about the things behind it, this could be a good resource.  
The dataset is pretty simple though -- it tells the total cocoa imports from 2015 to 2019 by Americas market, Europe market, and Asia & Oceania market.  

#### My Visualization

As this is the last viz of 2020, I decided to do something slightly complicated. Inspired by all the great vizzes that utlized the sigmoid function to plot curves in Tableau -- for example, [this year's IronViz winner work](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/air-we-breathe?tab=viz-of-the-day&type=viz-of-the-day) -- I found a [tutorial](https://public.tableau.com/views/HowtoSigmoidFunction/SigmoidFunctionStory?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no&:display_count=y&:display_static_image=y&:bootstrapWhenNotified=true#1) and implemented it in this viz.

#### Insights
* As we know, Europe is the world's largest chocolate producer, however, it's not the largest cocoa producer. Therefore, we have been consistenly seeing most cocoa (>60%) imported to Europe;  
* But when we look at the data, one thing to note is that -- Economics courses tell us supply and demand will try to strike a balance, and here we are only looking at one side, that is the demand of Cocoa. The Cocoa import demand is determined by how much cocoa Europe itself can grow, how much chocolate the European manufacturers want to make, and of course, the demand and profitability of chocolate (the end product).
