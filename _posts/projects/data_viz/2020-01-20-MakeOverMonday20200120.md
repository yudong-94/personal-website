### *Is it time to treat sugar like smoking?*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20200120

This week's data comes from [The British Nutrition Foundation](https://www.nutrition.org.uk/nutritioninthenews/new-reports/ndnsyears7and8.html), and focuses on sugar consumption by different age and gender groups. I personally always feel that the sweets in the US (especially cupcakes) are way too sweet... But it seems like it's a much more severe issue than we typically expect. The original artcile can be found [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-48499195), and it actually links the over used of sugar to smoking.  

#### My Visualization

The viz I made is a yearly line trend across all the age groups, and put children, adult men and women side by side for easier comparison.

#### Insights
* UK teenagers consumes three times more sugar than recommended (5%), as a share of total calories;  
* Different from the popular view of women like sweets more than men, based on the survey, adult men actually consumes slightly more sugar than women.
