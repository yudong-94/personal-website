### *Land Use by Food Type*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 1210

This week's data is about the land needed per gram of protein by food type. The original article could be found [here](https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture). It's quite surprising to see that we need 1.02 square meters of land to produce one gram of protein from beef, but only 0.01 square meters to produce one gram of protein from pulses or maize. But of course, protein is not the only measure to compare the cost effectiveness of producing different food.  

#### My Visualization

This time I combined summary stats and bar charts to compare the land needed by different food type. You can use the dropdown on upper right to change the benchmark and the comparison.

#### Insights
* It's astonishing that the land needed to produce one gram of protein from Beef can produce almost 100 grams of protein from pulses;  
* From the perspective of producing protein, pulses and maize are the most effective food, while beef and pork are the worst.
