### *The USA lags behind other agricultural nations in banning harmful pesticides*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20200113

This week's dataset is very close to our daily life -- it's about how many of the pesticides used in USA agriculture are actually banned in EU, China and Brazil. The original viz can be found [here](https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-019-0488-0/figures/1). It is kind of confusing to understand the chart as it's showing number of pesticides banned in one country side by side with the number of pesticides banned in at least one or two or three countries...  
Also, somehow the dataset provided tells the weight of those pesticides, instead of number of kinds as in the original viz.  

#### My Visualization

Initially I was trying hard to create a Venn digram this week -- but then I found it hard to create a workaround for Veen in tableau with three groups, and actually the data source does not tell us the overlap between each two... So it turned out to be something super simple, with different color noting the different level of overlaps.

#### Insights
* There are over one quarter of the pesticides that used in the USA are banned in EU;  
* Just looking at those pesticides that are allowed in the US, EU appears to have the most strict regulation on pesticides. But it would be interesting to know the real banned pesticides overlap among all the possible harmful pesticides.
