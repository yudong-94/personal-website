### *% Childen Out of School 2002-2020*

As always, I was spending lots of time trying to find an interesting dataset to visualize this week... Then, this idea suddenly came to my mind - 'why not ask ChatGPT?' So I asked, and it says *'One interesting dataset that you could use to visualize data is the World Bank Development Indicators dataset. This dataset contains a wealth of information about economic and social development in countries around the world, including indicators such as gross domestic product, population, and unemployment rate. You could use this dataset to create visualizations that show how these indicators have changed over time, both globally and for specific countries or regions. This could be a useful resource for researchers, policymakers, and others who are interested in understanding the state of the world's economy and the factors that drive economic development.'*. Here we go, [World Development Indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators#)!

#### My Visualization

As the World Development Indicators datasets have tons of metrics to explore, the metric I picked this week is the % childen out of school, by country aggregation on income level, and by gender. The visualizaion puts different country groups side by side, with three lines indicating female, male and total. In this way, it is easy to compare in both dimensions.  

*Please notice that all the visualizations are designed for desktop view, so it is recommended to view them on a desktop device.*

#### Insights
* Firstly, it is great to see this great trend of declining % childen out of school in the past 20 years, especially in the lower income countries;  
* Secondly, it is not surprising at all to see this correlation between % children out of school and country income level, as education makes a big part in economy and development;  
* Lastly, you will also notice that lower income countries tend to show more gener inequality as there are larger gaps between male and female out of school rate. But for high income countries, the three lines almost overlap.
