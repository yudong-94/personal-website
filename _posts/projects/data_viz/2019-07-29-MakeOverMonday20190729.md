### *STD Infections Rates in America*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190729

This week's data is about STD (Sexually Transmitted Diseases) Infections Rates in America. The original dashboard could be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/andy.kriebel#!/vizhome/STDs1996-2008/STDInfectionRates). It's a dashboard published in 2003 (the time when Tableau Public is just a thing).  
As for the dataset, seeing STD infection rate going higher and higher overtime is definitely not a good sign.  

#### My Visualization

To understand what drives the overall increase of STD infection rate, I tried to segment the rate by disease, age, and gender, also with the ability to filter on the states by clicking on the map.

#### Insights
* The increase in STD infection rate is mainly driven by the increase in Chalmydia infection rate, especially of female;  
* Also, Chalmydia is the only one of the three that we observe a very different infection rate between male and female;  
* State wise, Alaska shows the highest STD infection rate, followed by Mississippi.
