### *A bird’s-eye view of clinical trials*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190812

This week's data is the clinical trials of ten largest pharmaceutical companies since 2000, including the start time, phase, status, people recruited, and most importantly, the condition the trials is for.  
The original article and viz could be found [here](https://www.statnews.com/2019/07/18/clinical-trials-birds-eye-view-drug-development/). The article is very insightful. The viz is pretty fancy (looks like some mordern art...), and keeps all the information (but this is also the problem of the viz).   

#### My Visualization

Instead of keeping all the info of the dataset as the original viz does, my viz focused on the top 10 conditions with most people recruited for trial only.

#### Insights
* Influenza is so far the condition that recruited most people for trial -- this is understandable, as Influenza is a very common disease with lots of peole suffered from it, however, it's not the condition with most trials;  
* Some diseases are mainly focused in some years -- for example, >150k people enrolled for the trails on Rotavirus Infection in early 2000, but the trial size gets much smaller later (I hope it's because a good cure has been found).
