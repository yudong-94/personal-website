### *World Development Indicators – Health and Equality*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190304

This week's topic is on "World Development Indicators – Health and Equality". The dataset is from The World Bank, and MakeoverMonday is collaboration with [Operation Fistula](https://www.opfistula.org/) on this speicfic visualization project. You can find the detailed definition of all the metrics [here](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2019w10/workspace/file?filename=Operation+Fistula+-+Makeover+Monday+International+Women%27s+Day+Documentation.pdf). If you are interested in knowing more about gender equality and women health condition over the world, I would highly recommend you explore this dataset. It's astonishing for me to see women are still suffering so much in many part of the world -- giving birth to a baby is still fatal to them.   

#### My Visualization

Due to the large amount of missing data in this dataaset, things we can do are highly restricted. So I picked China (my homeland), and two metrics with relatively complete records -- GDP and Lifetime Risk of Maternal Death (%). And they show perfect negative correlation.

#### Insights
* With economic development from 1990 to 2015 in China, we see the maternal death risk dropped 86% (from 28% to 4%). This is easy to understand -- better healthcare envrionment must come from better economic condition.
