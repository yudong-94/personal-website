### *Avocado Prices*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 1001

This week's data is about the Avocado volume and price from 2015 to 2018. It's on the region and type level -- each day, in each region, how many original/or conventional Avocado were sold at what price. The original report could be found [here](https://overridge.com/market-update/market-update-oct-17).  
By the way, I love Avocado Smoothie!

#### My Visualization

As we are talking about Avocado, the color palette I used this week is green and brown.  
I tried to visualize the data from four different angels -- trend of price and consumption, consumption by region, price by region, and price by type.  
Also, hope you enjoy the cute Avocado :)

#### Insights
* The trend of price and consumption are perfectly inversely correlated, which matches the free market economic theory -- when price goes up, fewer people buy, then more supply and price goes down...  
* We can clearly see spikes every year in early Feb, around the time of Super Bowl;  
* The organic avocado is always ~2x of the price of conventional avocado;  
* West region consumes most Avocado, and the price there is also relatively low comparing other regions -- California is one of the regions that produce most Avocado.
