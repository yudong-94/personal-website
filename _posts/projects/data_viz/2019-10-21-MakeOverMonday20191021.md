### *The age at which most people are dying by suicide*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20191021

This week's dataset is heavy and serious -- Deaths by suicide in England and Wales since 1981. It has the # of suicide by age every year, and the original article could be found [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/articles/middleagedgenerationmostlikelytodiebysuicideanddrugpoisoning/2019-08-13). The original viz is made by d3, and the interaction is pretty fancy.    
There are tons of reasons that could make people feel desperate about life, and that could happen to anyone. However, please, don't give up hope. Tomorrow is always a new day.  

#### My Visualization

Making a heatmap is my first intuition looking at this data. And instead of doing year vs. age as the original dataset, I did birth year vs. age, so that it would be easier to compare generations.

#### Insights
* More suicides happen during middle ages, comapring to other age groups (potentially middle age crisis);  
* Somehow, the Gen X shows much higher suicides than the other generations;
