### *Safe Houses For Girls At Risk of FGM in Tanzania*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20200601

This week's dataset is around two safe houses ran by [HOPE FOR GIRLS AND WOMEN TANZANIA](https://hopeforgirlsandwomen.com/safe-houses/). This organization helps to protest girls from FGM in Tanzania, which violates human rights, and reflected deep-rooted inequality between sexes. You can find more info about it in [this report] (https://hopeforgirlsandwomen.com/about-fgm-in-tanzania/). As a female, I cannot really how imagine how painful it would be, and I think this kind of harm would have life-lasting impact on those young girls. I feel so sad that they have to go through this nightmare, yet people in those regions sometimes take it for granted...    

#### My Visualization

The dataset is pretty rich with when the girls are adimitted at what age and with what health/other conditions. So I picked some key data points and made a report.

#### Insights
* Most of the girls arrived at the safe houses at young year ~14 during the so-called 'cutting season';  
* We are seeing the highest number of protection cases from Mara region in Tanzania, which is corresponding with the fact that Mara is the region with the highest prevalence of FGM in Tanzania;  
* There are 35% of the girls arriving at the safe houses with some health issues, which indicates the poor living/health condition of young girls there.
