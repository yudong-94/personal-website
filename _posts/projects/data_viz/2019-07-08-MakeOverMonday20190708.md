### *Asylum Applications in EU*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190708

This week's dataset is around the Asylum applications in EU countries from people outside EU from 2009 to 2018 by decision types. You can find the original article [here](https://www.easo.europa.eu/asylum-trends-annual-report-2018). 

#### My Visualization

I created a simple dashboard displaying the total appliation and approval rate trend overtime. When you hover on the total application bars, you will see the top countries with highest applications, also the approval rate on the right will filter on the corresponding year accordingly.
