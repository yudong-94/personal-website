### *Trump’s “Executive Time”*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190211

This week is about President Trump's office schedule from Nov 7th 2018 to Feb 1st 2019. You can find the original article [here](https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-private-schedules-leak-executive-time-34e67fbb-3af6-48df-aefb-52e02c334255.html). It explains each category of the schedule and some caveats of the public avaialble schedule.  
The data itself lists each event's start time, end time, topic, and category.  

#### My Visualization

To make a similar heatmap as the interactive one you can find on the original article, I had to transfrom the data into one time point per row, and create an Eventid to link start and end time of each event. Then I used line chart with Eventid as the detail to plot a similar heatmap. As the heatmap shows the overall pattern of the schedule and it's a little bit colorful (hard to read), I added the stats highlights on the right. This dashboard took me around two hours from data cleaning to publishing.

#### Insights
* President Trump took 12 days off from Nov 7th to Feb 1st, much longer than I did...  
* But his average work hour is 9.9 hours daily, which is longer than me, so I will not blame him for taking more days off than me;  
* 59% (more than half) of his worktime during this period is marked as 'Executive Time', it could be some flexible time for him or something cannot be disclosed to public.
