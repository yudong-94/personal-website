### *Consumer Spending by Generation*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190325

This week's data is tiny yet very interesting -- it compares for the four generations (Millenials, Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Traditionalists), how much they spend on Groceries, General/Misc, Restaurants, Elec/Hobbies/Clothing, Gasoline, and Pharamacies. The data is presented as % of money spent on each category by rach generation, so it always adds up to 100% for each generation. This makes it more comparable among the generations, as they have different age and thus definitely very different wealth and buying power.  
You can find the original article [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chart-reveals-huge-difference-millennials-201133732.html).

#### My Visualization

I tried many different (and all very traditional) ideas this week -- stacked bar chart (the original viz), bar chart in grid, bubbles in a row, ... I ended up mixed the bubble idea with line chart to better compare where Millenials and Traditioalists stand.

#### Insights
* All the generations spend a lot on Groceries;  
* Yet Traditionalists spend a much higher percentage on Groceries than Millenials, while Millenials spend a much higher percentage on Restaurants (and Gasoline) -- maybe Millenials tend to eat out more;  
* Another contradiction is Traditionalists spend more on General/Misc, while Millenials spend more on Elec/Hobbies/Clothing.
