### *Unicorn, Decacorn and Hectocorn startups in 2021*

This week, I am looking at [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/prasertk/unicorn-decacorn-hectocron-in-2021), listing all the unicorns, decacorns, and hectocorns startups around the world. It has compony level info with country, date became a 'unicorn', current valuation, industry, investors, etc. It's a rich dataset to explore the most valuable private companies.  

#### My Visualization

Looking at the columns, I have two questions -- what industry is generating most unicorns, and when did the existing unicorns become unicorns. With these two questions in mind, I did an industry level aggregation, with a scatter plot showing all the unicorns in the industry, their current valuations and when they became unicorns, and summary status of the unicorns.  

*Please notice that all the visualizations are designed for desktop view, so it is recommended to view them on a desktop device.*

#### Insights
* Most existing unicorns became 'unicorns' between 2018-2021 (as many valuable private companies will ended up IPO), and there is a clear correlation between time since unicorn and their valuation, which makes tons of sense...  
* Looking at the industries, fintech seems to have most unicorns both by numbers and by total valuations at this moment, also it has the youngest group of unicorns with lowest median years since unicorm of 0.6 years -- Brex is one of them :)
