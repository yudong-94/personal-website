### *H-1B Approvals by Employer*

H-1B is a US visa type that many people hold to legally work in the US. There have been many changes to H-1B policies, including who qualifies, the lottery process, etc. The new president will likely bring even more uncertainty to it. This week, I looked up some H-1B data from USCIS website, I decided to visualize the [top H-1B employers](https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub) since 2016.  

#### My Visualization

This visualization is a bump chart, with each line representing the change of total H-1B approval volume rank between 2016 and 2024 (as of 09/30/2024). You might notice that I have used two color palette -- the blue-ish ones are the tech companies, while the orange-ish ones are the consulting companies.  

*Please notice that all the visualizations are designed for desktop view, so it is recommended to view them on a desktop device.*

#### Insights
* Among the top 10 employers, we see more consulting companies (orange-ish lines) like Cognizant, Infosys and Tata before 2020, but fewer in the recent years. To my understanding, these consulting companies usually file H-1B for lots of people (in many cases, people outside of the US) and act as outsourcers or staffing firms for US companies. The recent drop our their percentage in the top 10 could be related to the pandemic, which prevented many foreign workers coming to the US, or related to recent H-1B policy changes;
* Mneawhile, we see the top US tech companies (blue-ish lines) high on the list as well. Amazon (here I combined Amazon and AWS as they technically file H-1B separately) climbed up from 6th in 2017 to 1st in 2021, and staying in the 1st place since then. You can also find other well-known names like Google, Meta, Microsoft and Apple.
