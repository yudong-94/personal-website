### *Animal-free products consumption in Great Britain*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20200608

This week's data is about animal-free products consumption in the UK. The original chart is a simply stacked bar chart, and can be found [here](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1065843/animal-free-products-consumption-frequency-in-great-britain-by-eating-habits/). I spent some time to understand the terms involved here -- 'flexitarian' concept is pretty interesting lol. My initial thought was that Vegan should eat 100% animal-free products, but then I realized here the question is speicially about meat-free / animal-free products such as meat alternatives or dairy substitutes, and those vegan might not even eat anything like that, but simply eat friuts and vegetables. Also, meat-eaters may choose to eat those products due to lactose intolerance or similar reasions.    

#### My Visualization

Well, stacked bar chart is good but a little boring... So I plotted number of respondents with little human icons this time :)

#### Insights
* Over 80% of the vegans eat animal-free products at least weekly, while only 11% meat-eaters eat animal-free products at least weekly;  
* There are more pescatarian who eat animal-free products at least some time, than vegetarians -- makes sense as pescatarian eats fish but not other meat.
