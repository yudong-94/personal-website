### *Most Popular Sports Among US High School Boys and Girls*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20200615

This week, we are looking at the sports popularity among high school boys and girls in different US states. This dataset is an extension from this [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-is-the-u-s-so-good-at-womens-soccer/), talking about popularity of soccer among high school girls. Seems like the great achievement of US women's national soccer team has greated a very good positive feedback -- more girls are participating in this sport, and enabling the women soccer team to continue its success in the future.  

#### My Visualization

Since the dataset provides numbers for both boys and girls, and by states, I am putting top popular sports of boys and girls side by side for an easier comparison.

#### Insights
* For high school boys, Football (11-player) is the sport that dominates most states, except a few states in the north, and this has always been the case since 2000s;  
* But for high school girls, there are more variance among the states -- most of the states in the middle are dominated by volleyball, but there are many other popular sports like basketball, soccer, track and field, etc.
