### *OECD Parental Leave System*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).


### Makeover Monday 0723

This week's topic is about Paid Parental Leave policy across the world. In the dataset, there are three categories of Paid Leave - Maternity Leave, Parental Leave, and Total Leave. You can find the detailed explanation and report [here](https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/PF2_1_Parental_leave_systems.pdf).  
The original viz is a very simple bar chart, comparing the paid leave length and average payment rate. I think a better way would be put this two info on the two axis, and comparing countries across the two dimensions.  


#### My Visualization

As said above, I put the paid leave length and average payment rate on the two axis, and use the average to split the countries into four categories - long leave and high pay, short leave and high pay, long leave and low pay, and short leave and low pay. I also marked the four countries gruops with different colors on the scatter plot, as well as on the map. When you hover on every data point / country on the map, the corresponding part in the other chart will be highlighted as well. You can also change the leave category on the upper right.

#### Insights
* Genereally speaking, European countries, especially Eastern European countries have better (or more generous) Maternity/Parental Leave policy.  
* Countries have different tendency - some tend to emphasize on better Maternity Leave, while others trying to offer better Parental Leave policy.
* Wondering... What happened to US...
