### *How much does union membership benefit America’s workers?*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20191202

This week's data is about US median weekly salary by whether in workers' union or not, by race, and by gender. The idea the [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2019/nov/24/how-much-does-union-membership-benefit-americas-workers) tries to convey is that being a union member could benefit a worker with significantly higher salary. However, I personally believe the whole picture cannot revealed by just looking at these high level data, as there are a lot of confounding factors including industry, occupation, population size, etc., which all impact salary greatly.  

#### My Visualization

To avoid potential misleading breakdown (like the huge gender pay gap shown in the article), I tries to show high level trend only with disclaimers on the top.

#### Insights
* As I mentioned, though union members consistently show a higher wage than the non-members, it does not imply a causation between union membership vs. salary -- more confounding factors like industry, occupation, etc. must be carefully examined to draw any conclusion.
