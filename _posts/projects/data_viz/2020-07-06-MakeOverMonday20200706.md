### *Comparing Common Mental Disorder by Sex*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20200706

This week's dataset is on mental health. Though the dataset itself is talking about how frequent the mental disorder is by age and gender, the [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-41125009) actually carries much more info to help people understand the scale of mental health problem. It is pretty insightful, and I am suprised on how big a problem it is.  

#### My Visualization

Since we have two dimension -- age and gender, to show the trend of % of people with mental disorder symptoms across age groups and the differece between men and women, I used grantt chart this week.

#### Insights
* Among all age groups, female seems to be much more prone to mental disorder than male -- though in the article it also mentions that men has higher suicide rate;  
* Generally speaking, older age groups have lower proportion of people with mental disorder symptoms -- well, but I have to say that there is some sampling bias since people who lived to 75+ may be less likely to have experienced mental disorder;  
* One very weird age group is the group 16-24 -- men show much lower mental disorder proportion at this age, but women show very very high percentage -- my personal assumption is about the pressure women getting from the society at this age (from the society as they start career and even marriage).
