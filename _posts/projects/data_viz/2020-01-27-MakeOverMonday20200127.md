### *Bridges to Prosperity*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20200127

This week's dataset is about a nonprofit organization called 'Bridge to Prosperity', which partners with local governments to connect communities via pedestrian bridges. This is definitely great effort, as connecting people in rural areas to the cities will encourage them to communicate with external world, go out, and even do business with people outside, and in the end hopefully improve their living condition. The original viz could be found [here](https://bridgestoprosperity.org/global-work/zambia/).  

#### My Visualization

I tried to make something similar with Tableau -- a map with projects all around the world, and you can zoom into any single country.

#### Insights
* Most of the bridge projects are in Africa, as there are more under developed rural areas needing help in Africa;   
* Bridge to Prosperity also covered rural areas in South America, Southeast Asia, and there is even one project in the US.
