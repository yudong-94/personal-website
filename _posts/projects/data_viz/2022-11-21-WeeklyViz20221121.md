### *% Non-male Characters vs. % Women in Game Design Team*

I have been playing games quite a bit recently. This week, I came across [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/br33sa/gender-representation-in-video-games) on Kaggle, which collected data around gender representation in video games. Specifically, it looked at 64 top-rating or best-selling games released between 2012 and 2022, and how many of the characters in the game are non-male, their sexulization, and how many people in the game design team are female. This is a very interesting dataset as I am interested in, if the % of non-male characters is correlated with the % of female in game design team. So this became the topic for my visualization this week.  

#### My Visualization

The visualization itself is very simple -- simply put the two metrics I am looking at on x and y axis and added a linear regression trendline. If you hover on the line, you can actually see the regression fitted.  

*Please notice that all the visualizations are designed for desktop view, so it is recommended to view them on a desktop device.*

#### Insights
* The % non-male characters in the game seems to have a statistically significant positive correlation with the % of women in the game design team -- I won't be surprised that having female involved in game creation will increase the female representation in the game;  
* However, I also want to mention that this is a relatively small dataset and there could be many other confounding factors here. So it is not enough to draw a rigorous conclusion yet.
