### *Wastes on UK Beaches*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190401

This week's dataset is again tiny, but the topic behind it is pretty serious: what kind and how much wastes appear on UK beaches. As you may already know, ocean covers 70% of the surface of the Earth, yet human beings are throwing tremendous amount of wastes into the ocean, which is poisoning all the oceanic beings and in return destroy our own life. The [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-42264788) behind the dataset definitely worth reading, if you would like to understand how bad the current situation is.  

#### My Visualization

The dataset simply listed the top 10 kinds of wastes found on UK beaches and how much of them per 100 meters' stretch of beach. I do like the original viz -- simple and tell the story. So I also visualize the data in bubbles with a dark background to make the bubbles more stand out.

#### Insights
* Plastics/polystyerene picese appear to be the most frequent waste on UK beach -- and considering its typical large size, it's definitely the dominant waste on the beach. And they mostly come from careless public.
