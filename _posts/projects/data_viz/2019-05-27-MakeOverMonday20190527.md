### *CO2 emissions per capita*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190527

Macroecnomic data this week... The dataset is from the [World Bank on CO2 Emission Per Capita](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?end=2014&locations=AU-BE-CA-CN-DK-DE-IN-MX-US&start=1960&view=chart). I like the visualization tool the World Bank website provided, as it's simple and straightforward. The original viz selected nine countries, and you can see from the trendline that CO2 Emission per capita of US and the three European countries have been declining since 1970s, while that of China has increased exponetially along with its economic development.    

#### My Visualization

Another summary chart + map dashboard this week...

#### Insights
* Income level is positively correlated with the CO2 Emission Per Capita -- makes sense as developed economy means making more use of modern technology (especially electricity);  
* For the countries classified as high-income, there is a increase of CO2 Emission from 1960s to 1970s, but became flat afterwards;  
* While for upper-middle income and middle income countries, the increase happened in 2000s, indicating a different economic development cycle.
