### *U.S. Per Capita Consumption of Poultry and Livestock*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 1227

You may be wondering 12/27 is not a Monday, why I am doing a Makeover **Monday**. This is because I started doing Makeover Monday since 01/08, but missed the 01/01 one... To make up that one and to hit the target of finishing all the 53 sessions of Makeover Monday (yes I am a perfectionism), I decided to add a session today to work on the 01/01 dataset.  
The dataset on 01/01 is about the US Per Capita Consumption of Poultry and Livestock. It's surpising to see how people inclining towards poultry over time. You can find the original viz [here](https://www.theatlas.com/charts/SkwA7QzL), which is simple and effective.   


#### My Visualization

Trying to tell the story, I put one chart of absolute number trend with annotations, one chart of the relative difference trend, and another one comparing 1960 and 2015 consumption composition.

#### Insights
* Total meat consumption per capita in US has increased from 16k pounds to 22k pounds, increased by 34%;  
* The per capita consumption of Poultry has increased more than 2x since 1960, surpassed Pork consumption in 1975, and surpassed Beef consumption in 1988;  
* Beef consumption peaked in 1976, but has been decreasing since then. Comparing to 1960, it has decreased by 15% now;  
* Fish consumption has been growing slowly.  

Btw, curious about why we see red meat consumption dropped a lot, I did some research online. As [this article](http://fortune.com/2015/10/27/red-meat-consumption-decline/) addressed, red meat has been linked to cancer since 1970s. Also, producing beef is much more environmentally costly (see [MakeoverMonday 1210](https://yudong-94.github.io/personal-website/projects/data%20viz/MakeOverMonday20181210)), and beef price is much higher than poultry.
