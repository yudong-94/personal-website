### *Why America’s debt doesn’t stop growing*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20201123

This week's dataset is about US total public debt and GDP since 1960s. As the [original article](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/americas-debt-27-trillion-and-counting/) shows, at the beginning of 2000s, US GDP was still almost $5 Trillion higher than its total public debt. But ever since the financial crisis in 2008, the debt number has been surging, with a drop and later slow growth of GDP. As a result, since 2013, we have seen total public debt surpassing GDP. And the recent COVID pandemic makes the deficit even larger.   

#### My Visualization

I combined line chart with gantt chart to make this simple and clear chart this week.
