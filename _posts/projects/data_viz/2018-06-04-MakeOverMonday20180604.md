### *UK Gender Gap*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 0604

This week's topic is the gender pay gap in the UK. This is definitely an exciting dataset to look at. It includes the gender difference in median/average hourly pay, median/average bonus received, and the proportion of female in each pay quantile, in more than 10k companies in the UK.
The full report could be found [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-and-voa-gender-pay-gap-report-and-data-2017/hm-revenue-and-customs-gender-pay-gap-report-2017).  
And also, SF Pride is coming!  


#### My Visualization

This week's dataset is relatively large compared to the previous ones. Also, it contains info in different measures and dimensions. Therefore, in one hour, I mainly focus on finding insights from the data, i.e., how equivalent it is in UK as regarding pay.

#### Insights
* When we divide pay into four quantiles for each company - top, upper middle, lower middle, and lower quantile - generally speaking, the proportion of female decreases when the pay quantile goes up;  
* Male and female in larger size companies tend to be more equivalent as regarding pay;  
* For companies with size under 1,000, we are seeing largest deviation of differences in both median hourly pay, and bonus received.
