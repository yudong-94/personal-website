### *The Most Popular Makeover Monday Topics*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20191230

It's the last week of 2019!!! And the dataset wraps 2019 #MakeoverMonday well -- it's the dataset downloads of #MakeoverMonday since 2016. There is no better dataset to conclude this journey than this. The [original viz](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/e801e09d-b45c-4642-ba94-c887e69f781d/page/Wy89) is a simple bar chart of the top downloaded datasets.  

#### My Visualization

Instead of showing which dataset is downloaded most, I think showing how the downloads have grown tell a more impressive story.  
Also, I feel the best thing about #MakeoverMonday is that you can always learn something new -- I used the size card of Gantt plot for the first time this week.

#### Insights
* #MakeoverMonday downloads surged since 2019W39(09/23), and reached a record high downloads of 952 on W47 (11/18);  
* However, last year it has always been pretty low at ~ 40 downloads -- wondering when did data.world become the official dataset post site;  
* Not an insight, but I am curious that how the submission trend looks like -- does it follow the same pattern of downloads, or we will see a huge drop of submission rate after W39? (sadly the submission tracker dash is not downloadable, so I cannot find the answer lol).
