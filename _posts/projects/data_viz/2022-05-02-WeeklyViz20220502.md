### *FAANG Stock Prices (Past 5 Years)*

Recent months have been rough for the stock market. Two weeks ago, after the earning call, Netflix stock price dropped 35% due to the subscriber loss ([news](https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-stock-price-plunges-premarket-after-subscriber-loss-11650449002)). And it is not the only big tech that saw a big drop recently -- Google and Amazon stock prices also fell after the earning call. People have been using the acronym 'FAANG' for the five major technology stocks that include Facebook (now Meta), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet). This week, I am looking at their stock prices in the past 5 years.  

#### My Visualization

This visualization has a scatter plot of all the cities and their elevations by the states, with size indicating the populations. I also put a small map on the lower right. When you select one or more dots on the chart or the map, you will see the corresponding dots being highlighted in the other visualization.  

*Please notice that all the visualizations are designed for desktop view, so it is recommended to view them on a desktop device.*

#### Insights
* Among the FAANG stocks, Netflix has seen the largest drop as its closing prices on 4/29 is only comparable to its prices back in late 2017;  
* Apple stocks performs the best this year relatively as its stock price has 4x+ in the past 5 years and is only ~10% down by all time high;  
* FB and Amazon stocks today are close to where they were back in mid-2020.
