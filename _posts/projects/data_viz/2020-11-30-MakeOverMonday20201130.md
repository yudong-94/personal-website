### *The Success of Operation Fistula’s Pilot Program*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20201130

Another #viz5! For those who are not faimilar, Visualize Gender Equality - Viz5 - is an effort to help realize UN Sustainable Development Goal
5: achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Operation Fistula is an organization aims to alleviate, and even eliminate obstetric fistula, which  only happens in places where systems fail women and girls. It tested an idea of performance-based funding in the Pilot Program (2012-2015). This began as a bold idea to activate 5 partnerships in 3 countries, and ultimately resulted in 21 partnerships in 4 countries, and increased surgical throughput by 39%. On Tuesday, December 1, the world will come together to raise funds for charities and organizations like Operation Fistula. Therefore, to support it, this week we are looking at the success of this Operation Fistula's pilot program. You can find more information [here](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w48/workspace/file?filename=Info+Pack+-+Visualize+Gender+Equality+Data+Set+%2310.pdf).  

#### My Visualization

This week I created a report-style viz with key stats to visualize the success of this pilot program.

#### Insights
* In this sample data, we measured the success of Operation Fistula Pilot Program in five countires and its treatment for over 600 women;  
* Most of the patients treated are still very young, in their 20-30s; And on median they gained 13 years' life thanks to the surgery;  
* Each dollar spent in this program brings over 20+ more days to one's life :)
