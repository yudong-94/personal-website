### *Which States Produce the Most Wind Energy*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190218

This week's data compares the wind power capacity across the states in the US. Surprisingly, we see Texas leads the game in the US. You can find the original artical and viz [here](https://howmuch.net/articles/wind-power-in-the-united-states-2018).  

#### My Visualization

Different from most of the time, I decided to make this viz super simple this time. So it only carries one stats -- the installed wind power in each states. And I grouped the states into top 1, 2nd to 4th, 5th to 10th, and others, to show how Texas is comparing to the other states.

#### Insights
* The total installed wind power capacity of Texas exceeds the total of the 2nd to 4th highest states, and counts for more than 25% of the total installed capacity in the US;  
* Originally, I thought there should be some geographical pattern of which states consume more wind powers, but sadly I did not find any (or because I am not good at US geographics...)
