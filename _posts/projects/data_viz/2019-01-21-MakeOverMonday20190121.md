### *Energy Use at 10 Downing Street*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190121

This week, the dataset contains hourly electricity usage at 10 Downing St. in 2017. It is a home to the Prime Minister and her family, and a busy office and workplace for the PM and her support staff. And according to the [original article](https://platform.carbonculture.net/places/10-downing-street/9/), 100% of PMO’s electricity supply is on a green tariff, generated from renewable sources. It's good to see such data being public.  

#### My Visualization

My first thought to visualize this dataset is to make a heatmap between month and hour, to figure out the peak hour and peak month pattern of electricity usage. Then I decided to be creative this week -- instead of making a grid heatmap, I tried to make it a circle, as 0AM and 11PM are not two extremes of hours but are very close to each other in reality.  
On this [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/yu.dong#!/vizhome/MakeOverMonday20190121/ElectricityUsageat10Downingst?publish=yes), 0AM in Jan starts at the center of the circle, then counter-clockwisely, it rotates from 0AM to 11PM. From inner to outer circle, it visualizes data from 0AM Jan to 11PM December in a spiral.

#### Insights
* The 10 Downing St. clearly uses more electricity between 9AM to 3PM;  
* We see much more electricity consumption in Jun, July, Nov, and Dec in 2017, probably due to the weather.
