### *Zambia Southern Province Confirmed Malaria Cases*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 0416

This week's dateset is about the Zambia Southern Province Confirmed Malaria Cases. The data could be found [here](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2018w16-zambia-southern-province-confirmed-malaria-cases). Please note that this is a simulated data from http://visualizenomalaria.org, and please contact jdrummey@path.org for data question. Climate change has raised a lot of concern nowadays, but this is the first time that I have actually worked on a climate change related time series data. 
The original visualization is simple, and clearly shows the seasonality of Malaria outbreak, and the overall decreasing trend.  

#### My Visualization

Again, for this time series data, I tried to explore the data with two dimensions - yearly and monthly.
