### *Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190128

This week the dataset is about the European Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) from 2014 to 2018. DESI is a composite index that summarises relevant indicators on Europe’s digital performance and tracks the evolution of EU member states in digital competitiveness. There are five dimensions contributing to the final index: Connectivity, Human Capital, Use of Internet, Integration of Digital Technology, and Digital Public Service.  
You can find the original report and viz [here](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/desi). The original viz is a simple stacked bar chart, This can tell how the countries compare to each other and the breakdown of the index, but it could be a little bit hard to compare across the five dimensions.  

#### My Visualization

This week, I tried to build a dashboard style viz again. It consists of three charts -- Bar chart of overall DESI ranking across countries with the selected country highlighted, stacked bar chart of DESI trend from 2014 to 2018 of the selected country, and a radar chart comparing across the five dimensions.

#### Insights
* Overall, we see the Northern European coutries such as Denmark, Sweden, and Finland has highest DESI, indicating higher digital competitiveness;  
* From 2014 to 2018, most European coutries have seen great progress in DESI, especially on the Connnectivity dimension.
