### *Bay Area Road Test Pass Rate*

I finally passed my driving test last week!!! Due to various reasons (nervous, unexpected behaviors from other cars, lacking of practice, etc.), I did not pass it until the third try... And this makes me wonder, what is the driving test pass rate here in the bay area. I wasn't able to find any official stats, but came across [these stats](https://yogov.org/dmv/california/bay-area-dmv-road-test-pass-rates/) from YoGov. Looks like they calculated the pass rate based on the the data collected from their customers. As I've heard before, pass rate could vary a lot among DMVs, but did not expect it to differentiate this much...  

#### My Visualization

The visualization itself is very simple as a slightly adjusted version of stacked bar charts.

#### Insights
* The pass rates of different DMVs range largely from 33% to 79% (that's more than double);  
* Most of the DMVs in the bay area (except two) have a pass rate over 50%, which means if you take all the three chances, your fail rate should be as low as 12.5% (though the tests are obviously not independent...);  
* One DMV that really surprised me is San Francisco DMV -- SF is known for lots of slopes (and of course heavy traffic and complicated road situation), but the pass rate is as high as 73%. Maybe only the most confident drivers go to SF DMV to take the test :)
