### *Women in Power*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20200727

This week we are looking at another dataset with gender equality -- women in power by world bank, measured using % of seats held by women in national parliaments around the world. This dataset ranges from 1997 to 2019 on country level.  

#### My Visualization

Doing similar chart as last time -- line chart showing the trend in each country from the first record to the last, with the four income group highlights for easier comparison.

#### Insights
* Generally speaking, we are seeing a higher proportion of women in power around the world;  
* And there seem to be a strong correlation between income level and % of women in national parliament (hard to say whether it's causal and which leads to which though);  
* Which surprised me a lot is some of the top countries -- Rwanda has the highest proportion from the 2016 data, and it has also seen the highest increase in the proportion, and it's followed by Cuba and Bolivia.
