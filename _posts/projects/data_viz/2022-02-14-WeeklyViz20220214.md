### *Olympic Games Host Cities*

As the 2022 Winter Olympics is happening now in Beijing, I chose an Olympics dataset for this week. Beijing is the only city that has hosted both summer and winter Olympic Games. That makes wonder which cities have hosted Olympics and are there patterns among summer and winter game hosts. Therefore, the data I look at this week is the host cities of modern Olympics.  

#### My Visualization

I chose a map to viz the location of Olympic Games host cities and used different color coding on summer/winter games. The size of the shapes indicating how many Olympic Games the city has hosted (max as 3). And when you hover on a city, you can see the host years info below in the table.  

*Please notice that all the visualizations are designed for desktop view, so it is recommended to view them on a desktop device.*

#### Insights
* While Beijing is the only city that has hosted both summer and winter Olympics, some of the summer and winter Olympics host cities are quite close geographically (for example, LA and Tahoe, Montreal and Lake Placid);  
* While summer Olympics host cities are widely spreaded around the world (except Africa sadly), winter Olympics locations are more selective to accommodate the snow sports, and seem to be within a smaller range of latitude;  
* London has hosted the most number of Summer Olympic Games (three), and Paris and LA will soon join it.
