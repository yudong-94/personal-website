### *Worldwide Paid Subscribers Netflix vs. Disney+*

This week I subscribed to Disney+, to watch Bleach TYBW, which is streaming on Hulu only. I don't even have a Netflix subscription (as I am not very much into movies and TV series), but Disney got me this time :) As we all know, the streaming service market competition has been more and more fierce -- Netflix has been in the dominant position in a while, but there are so many other platforms now offering their streaming subscription services, just like Disney. And I still remember what happened to Netflix stock during its last earning call, due to low performance on user growth (though this is not solely due to competition). So this week, I found some paid subscriber growth data and made a visualization.  

#### My Visualization

The visualization again is very simple -- two lines showing the paid subscribers count of Netflix and Disney+. I also used gantt plot to add the differences bars.  

*Please notice that all the visualizations are designed for desktop view, so it is recommended to view them on a desktop device.*

#### Insights
* Disney+ was launched in Q4 2019 -- at that time, Netflix already has over 150 million paid susbcribers worldwide;  
* However, the Disney+ subscriber growth speed is very fast. It went from 0 to 137M in less than 3 years. This is not surprising as it owns so many great movies, TV series, and brands;  
* In Q3 2022, it is reported that the Disney streaming service (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+) adding together has reached 221M paid subscribers, exceeding Netflix of 220M paid subscribers.
