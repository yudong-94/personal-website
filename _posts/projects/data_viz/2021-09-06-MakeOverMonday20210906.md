### *What Do Americans Think About Abortion?*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20210906

This week, Texas has passed a law that bans abortion after cardiac activity can be detected. This has triggered lots of discussion on the issue. Honestly, as a woman, I believe we should have full control over our body. [This article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/) looked into survey data regarding people's opinion on Roe v. Wade and what they think about abortion. We are visualizing the time series of whether people think abortion should be legal/illegal over time this week.    

#### My Visualization

To show the divergent opinions on whether abortion should be legal, I combined gantt chart and line chart in my visualization.
