### *Marriage Rate by Age and Education*

This week I was looking at the **The Economic Daily** by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and found [this interesting report](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2025/at-58-years-of-age-64-percent-of-americans-born-during-1957-64-were-married.htm) on the marriage rate of Americans born 1957 to 1964. It shows a breakdown by age from 24 to 58, with the education level, providing insights to marriage timing.  

#### My Visualization

This visualization is a line chart of the marriage rate in five grids by the education level.

#### Insights
* Generally speaking, fewer than half of Americans got married by the age of 24, but the percentage jumped to almost 70% at the age of 34.
* Education level and marriage are strongly linked -- people with Bachelor's degree or higher show the lowest marriage rate at the age of 24 (only 31%), but they had the highest marriage rate from the age 34 and onwards.  
* But it is worth noting that this data is for the cohort born 1957 to 1964 -- the newer generations might have a different behavior in when they get married.
