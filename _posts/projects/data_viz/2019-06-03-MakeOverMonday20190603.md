### *Sleepless in America?*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20190603

This week's data is about how much time Americans sleep every day by age, gender, and type of day (weekday/weekend). It spans from 2003 to 2017. The original viz is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and can be found [here](https://www.bls.gov/tus/charts/sleep.htm). This is a very Excel-style viz (nothing wrong, but just feels very old-fashioned)... 

#### My Visualization

This data has three dimensions - age, gender, and type of day. It's always a challenge to visualize multiple dimensions together. But I still tried to put all of them into one chart. You will still be able to compare across any two dimensions easily in this chart (though I admit this is not always the best practice).

#### Insights
* Generally speaking, when people get older, then tend to sleep less. However, for the weekday data, you can see that the age group 56+ has the second longest sleep hour, which makes sense as they typically do not need to work at this age;  
* Not surprisingly, 65+ age group also has the shortest sleep hour gap between weekday and weekends;  
* Women tend to sleep longer than men.
