### *US Population Projection by Age Group 2016-2060*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 1105

This week's data is from US Census -- US Population Projection 2016-2060. It has four dimensions: sex, origin, race, and age group. The original viz is displayed below, and it shows that US is getting aging.

#### My Visualization

Excepting knowing that older people consist of higher proportion in US over time, it's also interesting to see the sex and race distribution. I combined these dimensions with the age group dimension to show the change in the generations as well.

#### Insights
* For new-born, actually there are always more male than females. However, after 60 days old, in older generations, females begin to have a higher proportion -- corresponding with the general perception that females have longer longevity;    
* Though the population size of young White people is predicted to decline over time, it's not the case for the other races;  
* We are seeing some very weird spike of population projection around 2030 for Age 60-79, which is potentially related to the baby boom in 1950s and 60s.
