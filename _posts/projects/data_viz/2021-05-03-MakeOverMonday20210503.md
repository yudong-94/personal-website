### *CEO-to-Worker Compensation Ratio*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20210503

This week's topic is very interesting -- CEO-to-worker compensation ratio. The original viz can be found in [this article](https://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-compensation-surged-14-in-2019-to-21-3-million-ceos-now-earn-320-times-as-much-as-a-typical-worker/), which shows the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio has been increasing over time, from only ~20 to over 320. I remember reading the news about Dan Price (here is [one](https://people.com/human-interest/ceo-dan-price-says-companys-revenue-has-tripled-since-he-gave-employees-70000-minimum-salary/)), who is the CEO of Gravity Payments, and gave employee $70k minimum salary by cutting his own pay. He said this effort actually improved employee productivity and led to significant company growth. So it's hard to say whether the increase in CEO-to-worker compensation ratio is a good/bad thing.

#### Insights
* Generally speaking, the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio has been increasing since 1965, and is 16x now (20 to 320). The fastest growth was seen right before 2000 -- the ratio tripled from 1995 to 2000;  
* The CEO-to-worker compensation ratio calculated with granted CEO compensation and realized CEO compensation used to align very closely before 1993, however, in recent 20 years, we have seen much more fluctuation.
