### *World Happiness Report 2020*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20200511

This week we look at the World Happiness report with happiness score around the world from survey conducted between 2017 to 2019. The full report can be found [here](https://worldhappiness.report/). It looks at how the hapiness score can be explained by different factors including GDP, social support, healthy life expectation, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perception of corruption.  

#### My Visualization

So this is a perfect case to make visualization with map. I also added a set action so that once you click on any of the countries, its scores on differnent factors will be highlights in the boxplot.

#### Insights
* Generally speaking, Northern European countries are the happiest in the world, following by North American countries, while Asian and African countries are on the lower end;  
* Only around 20% of the happiness score can be explained by GDP, but what plays a bigger role is actually the social support;  
* Except from the six factors considered, there are still a decent amount of happiness score cannot be explained -- well, happiness is definitely a complicated metric :)
