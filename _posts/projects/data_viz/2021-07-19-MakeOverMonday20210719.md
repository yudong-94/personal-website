### *UK COVID-19 Mortality Rate by Ethnicity*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20210719

This week is another COVID-19 related dataset. The data is speicifc about the death risk comparison among different ethinicities. And it's from [this COVID dashboard on Information is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/covid-19-coronavirus-infographic-datapack/). I can't believe I haven't came across this site yet as it has sooo many valuable COVID-19 data points with very well designed visuals. Really like it.  

#### My Visualization

I used a very similar way to visualize this data as the original viz - use gantt plot and dots to show death risk differences on ethnicity and sex level.

#### Insights
* On average, Black people show highest death rate from COVID-19 -- comparing to white people, they show increased risk of 2.7x for male and 1.9x for female;  
* Among all the ethnicity groups within BAME, we see higher death risk for male than female;  
* But of course, there are many confounding factors that are correlated to both ethnicity and death rate, and this datasets provided adjusted meansures by age, region, population, etc. Seeing how the numbers change after the adjustments, it's hard to make a call of what actually leads to the higher death rate and is Ethnicity really a deterministic factor.
