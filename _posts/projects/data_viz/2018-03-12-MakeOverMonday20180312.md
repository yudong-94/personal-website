### *Growth in Irish Whiskey Sales*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 0312

As St. Patrick’s Day is approaching, this week's data is about Growth in Irish Whiskey Sales. The original viz could be found [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-13/irish-whiskey-is-following-scotch-s-high-end-strategy).

#### My Visualization

The dataset the week is rather simple - year, country, and the sales (cases). So I paid more attention on crafting the vizz.
Actually, this is the first time that I adjusted the background color and imported an image :)  
Besides, you could hover on the bar to see the top 5 importers ranked by the count of cases normalized by country population.

#### Insights
* Althrough the total consumption of Irish Whiskey by Irish is relatively constant over time (Actually, it dropped a little bit in recent years), the export cases have been exploding this years - Irish Whiskey has been more and more popular worldwide;  
* When I normalized Irish Whiskey consumption by the country population, Irish is always on the top of the consumption - In 2016, on average, for every 100 Irish people, 10 cases of Irish Whiskey were consumed.  
* All the other countries on the top 5 consumption list are European countries - Latvia, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, and Sweden.
