### *Beer Cost at Every MLB Stadium*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 1022

This week, the dataset is about the cost of beer at every Major League Baseball stadium. It has the price, size of beer, and price per ounce. You can find the original viz and dashboard [here](https://www.vizwiz.com/2014/04/makeover-monday-what-beer-will-cost-you.html).  


#### My Visualization

Considering the size of beer differs at each stadium, I chose to compare the price per ounce, and show how the price rank changes. Besides, the size of the bubble is correlated to the price per ounce.
