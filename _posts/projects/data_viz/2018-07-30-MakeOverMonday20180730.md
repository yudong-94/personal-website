### *Big Mac Index*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).


### Makeover Monday 0730

This week's topic is about Big Mac Index, which is an indicator of whether a currency is under/over-valued or not. To understand it better, you can read this [article](https://www.economist.com/news/2018/07/11/the-big-mac-index). This makes me feel like going back to Macroeconomics Class...  
Besides, I really like the original visual (the dashboard) in the article -- it visualize the data from different perspectives: easy to compare over time and across different countires, yet very straightforward to understand.  

#### My Visualization

As inspired by the original viz, I created a list of country with the small bar chart to display overtime change as well. And on the right, as usual, put different countries on the map with average Big Mac Index as color.
