### *UK Pet Population*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 0319

This week's topic is pet population in the UK. There is a [report](https://www.pfma.org.uk/_assets/docs/annual-reports/PFMA-Annual-Report-2016.pdf) provided, and I do recommend you look at it, as there are sooooo many cute pet pictures!
The original viz is on the 14th page, and the data is rather straightforward - type of the pet, pet population, and percentage of households with this pet.  

#### My Visualization

I calculated one more metric based on the data prvided in the report: the average number of a certain pet kept by households with this pet. Please notice that becuase of the rounding issue of the data provided, some of the metrics may seem weird, for example, 0.9 guinea pigs per household with guinea pigs :)  
Again, as the dataset provided is simple, I spent more time on crafting the vizz (actually 2 hours+).
I tried hard to make a stacked donut chart. Thanks to this [Tableau community post](https://community.tableau.com/thread/202677).  
Besides, you could select one or more of the cute pet icons on the left to have a closer look or make comparisons.

#### Insights
* Dogs and cats are definitely the top 2 popular pets in the UK, 24% and 17% of the UK households have them;  
* However, more households have them does not neccessarily mean they have the largest population as pets in the UK - on average, for each household keeping outdoor fish as pets, they have 11 outdoor fish per household, and for those keeping indoor fish, this number is 6.9; On contrast, this number is 1.7 for cats and 1.3 for dogs;  
* I am really surprised that in the UK, close amount of households keeping horses as pets as those keeping hamsters...
