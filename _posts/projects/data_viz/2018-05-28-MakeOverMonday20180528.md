### *The World’s Most Expensive Prime Property*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

Starting from Jan 08, 2018, I decided to put aside one hour on Monday weekly to create some visualization and find some insights from the data.

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 0528

This week's topic is the most expensive prime property around the world - how much you can buy with one mollion US dollars. To my surprise, the most expensive city is not in US, and SF is not even on the list :). Though I can tell from my own experience that the rental in SF is much more expensive than LA :(  


#### My Visualization

This week's data is almost in the same format as two weeks ago (top 10 European cities with most traffic jam). Sadly, I cannot come up some new and interesting idea... So, map again...

#### Insights
* There are five European cities appear on the list as top expensive cities, including the top one city - Monaco (really unexpected to me).
