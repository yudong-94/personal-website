 This is my third blog of this series, summarising the great posts Elise and I came across during our Friday and Sunday night reading sessions. In these two months, we have been reading a lot about how to define the right product metrics. And as we read more on this topic, Medium recommend more and more posts on this topic to us (you know why). Maybe we need to tweak our reading habits a bit... Hope you enjoy the reading as we do :)  

#### Best of The Two Months
As every product has a north star metric, here is the north star blog for these two months :)  

[**A Brief History of Netflix Personalization**](https://marker.medium.com/a-brief-history-of-netflix-personalization-1f2debf010a1):  
When I first saw the name, I thought it would talk about the evolution of the recommendation system at Netflix. However, this article talks about more than that -- it covers product changes, features launches, model improvement, metrics improvement, and both succeeded and failed, and how they work together to improve personalization at Netflix. A very good reading of how a product iterates and succeeds.
