### My Medium Articles!  

In the past two months, I continued writing articles per month on Medium and Towards Data Science. Here you go:    
1. [**Google’s Data Science Agent: Can It Really Do Your Job?**](https://towardsdatascience.com/googles-data-science-agent-can-it-really-do-your-job/): Earlier this month, Google officially rolled out its 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐒𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐭 to most Colab users for free. It promises to turn plain-language goals into full-on data analyses — code, visuals, models, and all. I put it to the test using a real dataset—and wrote up what it gets right, what still needs work, and what it means for the future of our field.  
2. [**How AI Is Rewriting the Day-to-Day of Data Scientists**](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-ai-is-rewriting-the-day-to-day-of-data-scientists/): It is easy to get caught up chasing the latest AI tools. But at the end of the day, what matters most is using AI to eliminate what slows us down and accelerate what moves us forward. In this article, I looked at what AI tools we really need for DS and what's out there.
