**Five criteria to compare ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini in tackling Exploratory Data¬†Analysis**

### Context  

Welcome back to the second installment of my series, ChatGPT vs. Claude vs. Gemini for Data Analysis! In this series, I aim to compare these AI tools across various data science and analytics tasks to help fellow data enthusiasts and professionals choose the best AI assistant for their needs. If you missed the first article, I compared their performance in writing and optimizing SQL queries‚Ää-‚Ääbe sure to check it out!
Although the 2024 Olympics have concluded, our AI competition is just heating up. So far, Claude 3.5 Sonnet has taken the lead! But can it maintain its position, or will ChatGPT and Gemini catch up? üèÜ  

In this second article, we'll focus on their ability to independently conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). As a data scientist, imagine the convenience of having an AI tool that can instantly provide data insights and recommendations for a new dataset to inform advanced analysis and modeling. Let's see which model delivers the best EDA.

### What is¬†EDA  

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining and analyzing datasets to understand their main characteristics, often using visual techniques. It involves data cleaning, summarizing statistics, and identifying patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. The goal is to uncover insights that guide further analysis or modeling, ensuring a thorough understanding of the data before advancing to more complex tasks. Key components of EDA include:  
1. **Data inspection**: Understanding the dataset's structure (e.g., number of rows, columns, data types) and previewing the sample data.
2. **Data cleaning**: Correcting data types, handling missing values, and validating data (e.g., ensuring values are unique where necessary).
3. **Univariate analysis**: Performing descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, quantiles) on a single column with visualizations.
4. **Bivariate and multivariate analysis**: Exploring relationships between pairs and multiple sets of variables.
5. **Insights and recommendations**: Generating insights and actionable recommendations to inform further analysis or modeling.


### Evaluation Criteria  

We'll evaluate the three tools in 'self-driving' mode, providing only one prompt to conduct EDA and seeing how far they can go. The evaluation will be based on five key aspects:  
1. **Completeness** (5 points): Does the EDA report cover all five essential aspects, including data inspection, data cleaning, univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, and insights?
2. **Accuracy** (4 points): How accurate are the statistical calculations, visualizations, and insights or conclusions drawn in the report?
3. **Visualization Quality** (4 points): Are the visualizations clear, interpretable, and relevant to the report?
4. **Insightfulness** (4 points): Does the report generate insights based on the identified patterns, trends, or relationships?
5. **Reproducibility and Documentation** (3 points): Is the report well-documented, allowing others to reproduce the analysis?

### ChatGPT-4o  

**Total score: 19/20**

#### 1. Completeness (5/5)  

ChatGPT's EDA response begins with a summary of the steps it would take, covering all five critical components of EDA.  

**Data inspection**: One advantage of doing data analysis with ChatGPT is that it allows easy dataset preview by expanding the dataset directly in the interface.

<div class="container">
  <img src="https://yudong-94.github.io/personal-website/assets/images/llm-comparison/eda_chatgpt_inspection.png" alt="ChatGPT‚Ää-‚ÄäData inspection" width="600" height="400">
</div>

**Data cleaning**: ChatGPT performed the necessary steps, including filling in missing values and correcting data types. For missing values, it carefully evaluated the distribution of `income` and decided to impute them with the median income, offering sound reasoning.

<div class="container">
  <img src="https://yudong-94.github.io/personal-website/assets/images/llm-comparison/eda_chatgpt_cleaning.png" alt="ChatGPT‚Ää-‚ÄäData cleaning" width="600" height="400">
</div>

**Univariate analysis**: ChatGPT analyzed distributions for key features including `age`, `income`, `marital status`, and `education`, and provided summaries of the findings.

<div class="container">

</div>

**Bivariate and multivariate analysis**: ChatGPT explored the relationship between pairs of features, such as the correlation between income and total spending, and average spending by product categories. It again generated key insights from these analyses.

<div class="container">
  <img src="https://yudong-94.github.io/personal-website/assets/images/llm-comparison/eda_chatgpt_multivariate.png" alt="ChatGPT‚Ää-‚ÄäMultivariate analysis" width="600" height="400">
</div>

**Insights and recommendations**: ChatGPT provided key insights following each visualization sections, and concluded with clear and actionable recommendations accordingly.

#### 2. Accuracy (4/4)  

All the data cleaning, visualization, and analysis steps were backed by Python code. After manually running the code and comparing its results with those from Claude and Gemini, ChatGPT's outputs were accurate. Its insights also aligned well with the analysis.  

#### 3. Visualization (3/4)  

The visualizations created by ChatGPT were well-labeled with appropriate chart types and were accompanied by insights. You can also easily download the charts for documentation and presentations.  
My only complaint is that while some simple visualizations were interactive (allowing you to hover over them to see the values), most were not. You can find my detailed evaluation of this feature in my previous article. Therefore, I deducted one point for potential improvement¬†:)

</div>

#### 4. Insightfullness (4/4)
As shown in the screenshots above, ChatGPT provided more than four insights with concrete and actionable recommendations, earning full points here.  

#### 5. Reproducibility and Documentation (3/3)  

ChatGPT structured its report intuitively, with each section followed by code snippets to ensure reproducibility. Therefore, full credits are granted here.

### Claude 3.5¬†Sonnet  

**Total score: 16/20**

#### 1. Completeness (4/5)  

Claude's report was much shorter than ChatGPT, mainly because it did not display the visualizations, but only the text reports. However, it still covered most of the critical components of EDA.  

**Data inspection**: Although you could click on the uploaded CSV file, the preview was simply in text format, which was less digestible. Claude also did not provide any text description of the data structure. Therefore, I consider this step incomplete.

<div class="container">
  <img src="https://yudong-94.github.io/personal-website/assets/images/llm-comparison/eda_claude_cleaning.png" alt="Claude‚Ää-‚ÄäData inspection" width="600" height="400">
</div>

**Data cleaning**: Claude started its report with a "Data Quality and Cleaning" section, including steps like removing missing values, creating new columns, and cleaning up categorical values. You can clearly see the steps in the code snippet attached. Unlike ChatGPT, which chose to impute the missing income values with the median, Claude simply removed the rows with missing values. Given there were only 24 rows, I think both approaches were reasonable.

<div class="container">

</div>

**Univariate analysis**: Claude included univariate analysis code within its Python script and mixed the insights in its report.¬†


<div class="container">

</div>

**Bivariate and multivariate analysis**: Similarly, in the below screenshot you can see Claude's findings from bivariate analysis and the corresponding code.

<div class="container">

</div>

**Insights and recommendations**: After listing insights, Claude provided a comprehensive set of actionable recommendations with reasonable next steps.

<div class="container">
  <img src="https://yudong-94.github.io/personal-website/assets/images/llm-comparison/eda_claude_insights.png" alt="Claude‚Ää-‚ÄäInsights" width="600" height="400">
</div>

#### 2. Accuracy (3/4)  

I reviewed the Python script Claude generated and ran it manually. While most of the code was accurate, the correlation matrix section threw an error due to non-numeric columns being included. I shared a screenshot of this error with Claude, and it corrected the issue by adding `df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])` to filter on numeric columns only.  
This minor error resulted in a one-point deduction.  

<div class="container">
  <img src="https://yudong-94.github.io/personal-website/assets/images/llm-comparison/eda_claude_accuracy.png" alt="Claude‚Ää-‚ÄäAccuracy" width="600" height="400">
</div>

#### 3. Visualization (2/4)  

Unlike ChatGPT and Gemini, Claude did not display visualizations directly; it provided Python scripts instead. This is because it cannot execute Python code in the UI. But it does support running JavaScript and some other programming languages. I asked it to display the visualizations and it wrote JavaScript code with chart preview‚Ää-‚Ääbut the hard-coded numbers in the script did not align with the dataset, leading to confusion‚Ä¶  
I ran the Python scripts manually, and while they generated accurate visualizations (except for the correlation matrix error above), the overall experience was less user-friendly compared to the other tools. Therefore, I deducted two points for this limitation.  

<div class="container">
  <img src="https://yudong-94.github.io/personal-website/assets/images/llm-comparison/eda_claude_visualizations.png" alt="Claude‚Ää-‚ÄäJavascript code and visualization preview" width="600" height="400">
</div>

#### 4. Insightfullness (4/4)  

Despite the lack of visualizations, Claude's recommendations were insightful and actionable, covering areas  product focus strategy, campaign optimization, high-value customer retention and cross-sell opportunities. Full points were awarded for the quality of insights and recommendations.  

#### 5. Reproducibility and Documentation (3/3)  

Claude's response was clearly structured, with bullet points following the sequence of data cleaning, insights, recommendations, and next steps. The underlying Python code was accessible via the 'Artifact' window on the right. [Artifact](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9487310-what-are-artifacts-and-how-do-i-use-them) makes it easy to review and iterate on the code, reconcile it with the text report on the left, and even publish the code to share with others.

### Gemini Advanced  

**Total score: 19/20**

#### 1. Completeness (5/5)  

Gemini provided an exhaustive EDA, covering all critical components thoroughly.  

**Data inspection**: You can open the CSV file in Gemini to review the dataset closely (though not as interactive as ChatGPT). Gemini also included a paragraph describing the data structure.

<div class="container">

</div>

**Data cleaning**: Similar to Claude, Gemini corrected data types, calculated new columns (such as `age` and `enrollment period`), and dropped rows with missing values.

<div class="container">
  <img src="https://yudong-94.github.io/personal-website/assets/images/llm-comparison/eda_gemini_cleaning.png" alt="Gemini‚Ää-‚ÄäData cleaning" width="600" height="400">
</div>

**Univariate analysis**: Gemini conducted an exhaustive univariate analysis and printed 10+ histograms and boxplots to explore individual variables.¬†

<div class="container">
  <img src="https://yudong-94.github.io/personal-website/assets/images/llm-comparison/eda_gemini_univariate.png" alt="Gemini‚Ää-‚ÄäUnivariate analysis" width="600" height="400">
</div>

**Bivariate and multivariate analysis**: Gemini took a very thorough approach, generating over 50 visualizations across multiple grids, exploring nearly all possible variable pairs.

<div class="container">
  <img src="https://yudong-94.github.io/personal-website/assets/images/llm-comparison/eda_gemini_multivariate.png" alt="Gemini‚Ää-‚ÄäMultivariate analysis" width="600" height="400">
</div>

**Insights and recommendations**: After displaying all the visualizations, Gemini provided clear insights, followed by well-structured recommendations.

<div class="container">
  <img src="https://yudong-94.github.io/personal-website/assets/images/llm-comparison/eda_gemini_insights.png" alt="Gemini‚Ää-‚ÄäInsights" width="600" height="400">
</div>

#### 2. Accuracy (4/4)  

Gemini attached clear and easy-to-follow Python code. After reviewing and running the code, everything checked out. Its insights also matched the visualizations, earning full points for accuracy.  

#### 3. Visualization (3/4)  

Unlike ChatGPT and Claude, which used classic Python visualization packages `matplotlib` and `seaborn`, Gemini employed `altair` and saved the charts in JSON format to embed them in the chatbot UI. This made the charts highly interactive.¬†
However, as shown in the screenshots above, its high number (50+) of similar-looking charts, coupled with overlapping labels, made it difficult to interpret the data effectively. As a result, I deducted one point for visualization.  

#### 4. Insightfullness (4/4)  

Gemini summarised the key findings and provided actionable recommendations under two main categories‚Ää-‚Ää"product strategies" and "customer segmentation and marketing". These insights were actionable and well-aligned with the data, earning full points for insightfulness.  

<div class="container">
  <img src="https://yudong-94.github.io/personal-website/assets/images/llm-comparison/eda_gemini_recommendations.png" alt="Gemini‚Ää-‚ÄäRecommendations" width="600" height="400">
</div>

#### 5. Reproducibility and Documentation (3/3)  

Despite its response being longer than the other models due to the large number of visualizations, Gemini's report was well-structured, and the attached Python code ensured that the analysis could be easily reproduced. This earned it full points for reproducibility.  

### Final Results  

<div class="container">
  <img src="https://yudong-94.github.io/personal-website/assets/images/llm-comparison/eda_results.png" alt="Final scores" width="600" height="400">
</div>

The winner is¬†‚Ä¶ü•Å **ChatGPT-4o** and **Gemini Advanced**‚Ää-‚Ääwe have a tie!  

The final scores among the three models were close, with even the 3rd place Claude 3.5 Sonnet earning a respectable 16 out of 20 points, which is 80% of the total score. It's important to note that I conducted this competition with only one prompt! With guidance from data professionals, these tools' capabilities can be significantly enhanced.  

* **ChatGPT-4o** and **Gemini Advanced**: Both models lost just one point each. ChatGPT-4o was marked down for its limited interactivity in visualizations, while Gemini Advanced lost a point due to the cluttered nature of its visualizations.  
* **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Claude's main drawbacks were its inability to run Python code and display visualizations directly, along with a minor bug in its Python script. However, with its ability to run other programming languages like JavaScript, we might see it support Python visualizations soon!  

#### Additional Considerations  

When choosing your EDA assistant, here are a few additional points to consider:  

* **Selective vs. Exhaustive EDA**: Interestingly, ChatGPT and Claude tend to focus on selected columns they deem important, offering a more digestible and focused report; Gemini, on the other hand, provides an exhaustive analysis, generating a wide range of charts. Each approach has its pros and cons: a selective analysis is easier to follow, while an exhaustive one offers comprehensive coverage, which can be overwhelming. So it's up to you which style you prefer.
* **Output Stability**: I ran the same prompt with the same dataset three times in each tool so that I don't bias my evaluation towards a single run‚Ää-‚Äätheir response changes every time given the nature of LLM. This also makes me notice their different levels of output stability. Gemini showed the highest variance, with different report structures and content in each run. It generated a correlation matrix heatmap in one of the three runs and in another run, it even conducted a K-means clustering. Meanwhile, ChatGPT and Claude were more consistent, though they also varied in their choice of visualizations and insights. Therefore, if you're relying on LLMs for generating insights, it might be wise to run the same prompt multiple times to ensure you get the best possible output (and of course, you can always follow up and explicitly ask for anything missing)‚Ä¶
* **Response Speed**: Among the three, ChatGPT-4o was the fastest‚Ää-‚Ääit started responding almost immediately. Claude was slightly slower, taking about 10 to 20 seconds to kick off. Gemini took the longest time to start and to finish, given the huge number of charts it generated, but still below 3 minutes.

#### Conclusion  

If you're looking for a quick, clear EDA report, **ChatGPT-4o** is the way to go. But if you prefer an exhaustive exploration of your dataset and can tolerate less polished visualizations, **Gemini Advanced** might be the better option for you.
