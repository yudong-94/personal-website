### My Medium Articles!  

In the past two months, I continued writing articles per month on Medium and Towards Data Science. Here you go:    
1. [**Unlocking the Power of Machine Learning in Analytics: Practical Use Cases and Skills**](https://towardsdatascience.com/unlocking-the-power-of-machine-learning-in-analytics-practical-use-cases-and-skills-5201cf457360/): Ever confused by all the different titles in data science today? Do jobs with Data Scientist, Analytics titles also require Machine Learning skills? In this article, I share how the Machine Learning skills play a role in analytics with real-world use cases.  
2. [**DeepSeek V3: A New Contender in AI-Powered Data Science**](https://towardsdatascience.com/deepseek-v3-a-new-contender-in-ai-powered-data-science-eec8992e46f5/): DeepSeek is a new powerful player in the AI space. Its performance is on par with ChatGPT and Claude, but with a much lower cost. In this article, I evaluated its capabilities in data science use cases, including writing and optimizing SQL queries, conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and training machine learning models.   
3. [**Mastering 1:1s as a Data Scientist: From Status Updates to Career Growth**](https://towardsdatascience.com/mastering-11s-as-a-data-scientist-from-status-updates-to-career-growth/): Early in my career, I sometimes felt lost in 1:1s—unsure of what to discuss beyond status updates. Now, after being on both sides (as an IC and a manager), I’ve learned how great 1:1s can drive career growth, alignment, and impact. In this article, I shared my takeaways of running effective 1:1s as a data scientist.
