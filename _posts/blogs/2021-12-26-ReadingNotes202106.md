This is my sixth and last blog of this series this year, summarising the great posts Elise and I came across during our Friday and Sunday night reading sessions. Yay we made it to the end of 2021!  
This year we read ~300 Data Science blog posts, and summarized the best 130+ in this readong notes series. Looking back we have learned lots of new stuff acorss experimentation, machine learning, analytics, data engineer, product strategy, etc. Hope you enoy this last post and see you next year :)
