This post summarises the Medium blogs I read in the past two months. I have been exploring various LLM applications including GPTs and semantic search with the OpenAI embeddings API endpoint. Therefore, you will find multiple posts related to this topic. I have also been reading a lot about DS career and best data analytics practices. Hope you will enjoy the reading as well.
