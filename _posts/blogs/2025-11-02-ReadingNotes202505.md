### My Medium Articles!  

In the past two months, I continued writing articles per month on Medium and Towards Data Science. Here you go:    
1. [**Can a Non-Software Engineer Vibe Code a Real App with AI? I Tried It.**](https://medium.com/@ydong029/can-a-non-software-engineer-vibe-code-a-real-app-with-ai-i-tried-it-66825b93d8c4): During a short break between jobs, I challenged myself to vibe code a personal finance tracker—something simple but useful. In 20 hours, I went from idea → PRD → working app → deployment using ChatGPT, Cursor, and Codex…and lots of curiosity. This article documents my experience and my learnings.  
2. [**How I Used ChatGPT to Land My Next Data Science Role**](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-used-chatgpt-to-land-my-next-data-science-role/): The job search process can feel overwhelming, but tools like ChatGPT turn it into a more structured journey. In my latest article, I shared how ChatGPT acted as my personal career coach, helping me stay organized, efficient, and confident.  

### Reading List in Past Two Months  

Before talking about articles, I actually read one book in September -- [Matchmakers: The New Economics of Multisided Platforms](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1633691721/?bestFormat=true&k=matchmakers%20the%20new%20economics%20of%20multisided%20platforms&ref_=nb_sb_ss_w_scx-ent-pd-bk-d_k0_1_11_de&crid=1SHRCBS9KMO80&sprefix=matchmakers). As I got three-weeks break before starting at DoorDash, I decided to read a book to learn more about the marketplace business. This book did a through walkthrough of the history of marketplace business and its common challenges.
