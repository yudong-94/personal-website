This summer I got the opprotunity to mentor an intern in the Product Analytics team at Ancestry. I personally learned a lot from my mentor when I was an analyst intern three years ago (he later became my first full-time manager, and has been the one I turn to whenever I need career guidance). Therefore, I feel like it's the perfect time for me to give back to those who helped me along the way. I am putting together this reading list as a gift to my intern, hoping except from the hands-on experience, he also gets more inspiration in his Data Science & Analytics career from this internship.

### III. Machine Learning  

#### *Online Courses*  
There are just too many :) The one from [Andrew Ng on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) is probably the most well-known one, but you will see 742 search results just with the keyword ‘Machine learning’ on Coursera. I personally enjoyed this [Machine Learning specialization by the University of Washington](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning) when I was a beginner as it covers the most popular and basic algorithms with good business examples.  

#### *Books*
1. [An introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf)  
Always known as ISLR. Intro textbook to most machine learning concepts and algorithms with R codes.  
2. [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)  
Always referred to as ESLR, another well-known textbook on machine learning.
