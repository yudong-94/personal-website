This is the fourth year since I started reading data science blogs (mostly on Medium) every Friday and Sunday night. This habit has brought me immense self-fulfillment, and it's a journey I'm eager to continue. To share this passion, I will continue to post a bi-monthly compilation of the great articles I encounter, with the hope that you'll find as much joy and inspiration in them as I do. :)
