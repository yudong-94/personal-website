### My Medium Articles!  

In the past two months, I continued writing articles per month on Medium and Towards Data Science. Here you go:    
1. [**A Product Data Scientist’s Take on LinkedIn Games After 500 Days of Play**](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-product-data-scientists-take-on-linkedin-games-after-500-days-of-play/): After 500 days of playing LinkedIn Games, I finally turned this little habit into a product data science case study. In this article, I share my thoughts from the perspective of a data scientist: Why might LinkedIn have built Games in the first place? How does the feature create a habit loop that drives retention? Why do we see small UI changes appearing from time to time? How would a Product Data Scientist design experiments and measure success?  
2. [**I Tracked Every Article I Wrote in 2025 — Here’s What the Data Says**](https://medium.com/@ydong029/i-tracked-every-article-i-wrote-in-2025-heres-what-the-data-says-2b52883cfc95): In this article, I double-clicked into my 2025 writing journey -- 12 articles, 36.5k reads, and $2,960 earned. It shows a data-driven breakdown of what actually worked, what didn’t, and the trade-offs behind those outcomes.
