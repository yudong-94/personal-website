### My Medium Articles!  

In the past two months, I continued writing articles per month on Medium and Towards Data Science. Here you go:    
1. [**The Secret Power of Data Science in Customer Support**](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-secret-power-of-data-science-in-customer-support/): Most data science stories focus on product or marketing. But Customer Support is another data goldmine. n my latest article, I walk through how I have worked closely with our Customer Support (CX) team, helping them track performance, plan resources, optimize internal processes, and identify customer pain points.
