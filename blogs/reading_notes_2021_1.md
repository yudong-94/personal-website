## Reading Notes 2021 Jan - Feb

This year, I put reading data science related Medium & blog posts on my resolution list -- the plan is to read three posts on Friday night and three on Sunday night every week. Very foturnately, I also find a friend doing this with me so we can share thoughts, great articles, and brainstorming :) And not surprisingly, in just two months, my reading notes have grown to 20+ pages. Therefore, I decided to pick the best ones I read in the last two months, and share it here.
