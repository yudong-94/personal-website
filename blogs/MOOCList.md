## Online Courses Reviews

Online courses have been a great supplementary part to my offline study and work. Whenever I am interested in exploring some new fields, or find myself lacking some key skills, I would turn to them.
This blog keeps a list of online courses I have taken. I also include some notes on those courses for your reference. Most of the courses are on computer science, statistics, data analytics, or machine learning.

### Coursera

[Coursera](https://coursera.org) is the very first MOOC platform I have ever tried. It is a platform led by Stanford University and many other top universities around the world, and it offers online courses from these universities. When I was an accounting-major Junior, I was thinking about transitting into the world of computer science and data science, but I was not sure whether that was the right thing for me to pursue. Therefore, I took a number of courses in these fields on Coursera. I enjoyed these courses a lot (I mean, much more than the accounting courses), and they strengthened my confidence in pursuing a MS Business Analytics degree in the US and entering the data science world.

[Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval)|Machine Learning|Aug 2016|The last course of the **Machine Learning** Specialization by UW. It covers similarity calculation, TF-IDF, LDA, etc. Again, this is a great specialization with a lot of real-world examples and coding exercies (althrough it did not use a very popular machine learning package in Python like sklearn).|
[Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)|Machine Learning|Jan 2017|The very famous machine learning course by Andrew Ng. Definitely great course and great professor. This course covers common machine learning algorithms in details, though it uses Matlab or Octave. |



### edX

[edX](http://courses.edx.org) is another awesome MOOC platform led by MIT and some other top universities and institutions.

Courses | Topics |Time | Notes
:-------|--------|-----|:------

### Udacity Courses

I personally believe that the best thing about [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) is that many of the lecturers actually come from those tech giants in the Silicon Vally. Therefore, the courses on Udacity is much closer to the real business world practices. Besides, the course format of Udacity is quite different from Coursera and edX - it includes very short and interactive videos with bunch of small quizzes poping up between the videos.

Courses | Topics |Time | Notes
:-------|--------|-----|:------
[Intro to Machine Learning](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud120)|Machine Learning|Feb 2017|This course also uses scikit-learn in Python to explore common machine learning algorithms and includes practical exercises on a real dataset (the famous Enron dataset -- as an accounting-major undergrad, it is just too much familiar to me). |
[A/B Testing](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud257)|Data Analytics|Jan 2018|A/B testing course by Google. This is a great course to bridge the gap between what we learned in stats class and what is actually doing in real business world.|


### Lynda

[Lynda](http://lynda.com) offeres very short (typically in 2-4 hours) and introductionary level courses in all fields. Therefore, it is always the place I go to, to find some quick tutorials to get started with something, or to review some staff learned before. For example, before I started my summer internship, I took three courses on Tableau to refresh my knowledge and learn more practical skills; To prepare myself for a course with Data Mining projects in Scala, I took the Scala Essential Training course.

### DataCamp

[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) is an emegering MOOC platform, specialized in data science courses with R, Python and SQL. It offers courses on all kinds of specific data science topics (but mostly introductionary level). And as it is subscription-based, i.e., users pay monthly (or annually), it could be a good choice for someone who wants to learn R or Python from the beginning, and who has much spare time to focus on learning in one or two months.
