## Online Courses List

This blog keeps a list of online courses I have taken and some notes on some of the courses. 
Most of the courses are on statistics, data analytics, and machine learning.

### Coursera Courses

Courses | Topics |Time | Notes
:-------|--------|-----|:------
[Data Visualization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/datavisualization)|Data Viz|Aug 2015|<br />Introduce seom general data viz principles and fancy tools.<br />|
[An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1)|Computer Science|Aug 2015|<br />Excellent course!!! It's the first course of the Fundamentals of Computing Specialization by Rice University. It teaches basic Python by building small games. And the faculty is very accessible and friendly. Strongly recommend it to someone wants to learn Python.<br />|
[An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 2)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-2)|Computer Science|Oct 2015|<br />Second part of the above one. The final project is to build a Asteroid game. Super fun and helpful.<br /> |
[Data Processing Using Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/hipython)|Computer Science|Nov 2015|<br />Great to see a Coursera course by a university in China. This course covers some basics of the common data processing packages in Python (Numpy, pandas, etc.).<br /> |
[Using Python to Access Web Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data)|Computer Science|Nov 2015|<br />This is the third course of the Python for Everybody Specialization from UMich. The Professor is excellent. The content covers some basics of web, Regex, and web scraping with beatifulsoup.<br />|
[Using Databases with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-databases)|Computer Science|Dec 2015|<br />This is the fourth course of the Python for Everybody Specialization from UMich. It covers basics of databases, and how to connect Python to SQL server.|
[R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming)|Computer Science|Jan 2016|<br />Basic R programming. The assignments are not much related to the lectures (maybe a motivation to self-learning).<br /> |
[Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations)|Machine Learning|Jan 2016|<br />The first course of the Machine Learning Specialization by UW. It gives a lot of real-world machine learning applications to inspire the interests on machine learning. The professor could convey those complex ideas very clearly.<br /> |
[Principles of Computing (Part 1)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/principles-of-computing-1)|Computer Science|Feb 2016|<br />The third course of the Fundamentals of Computing Specialization. The assignments are still small games, but involves more mathematical concepts and algorithms.<br /> |
[Managing Big Data with MySQL](https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-mysql)|Data Analytics|Feb 2016|<br />Very good course to learn database principles and SQL. It provides some real datasets on the Teradata server for exercises and quizzes.<br /> |
[Principles of Computing (Part 2)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/principles-of-computing-2)|Computer Science|Mar 2016|<br />The fourth course of the specialization. It begins to explore some more advanced CS topics such as stack and queue, recursion and trees.<br /> |
[Machine Learning: Regression](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression)|Machine Learning|Mar 2016|<br />The second course of the Machine Learning Specialization by UW. Great course with a lot of real-world examples and coding exercies.<br /> |
[Algorithmatic Thinking (Part 1)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-thinking-1)|Computer Science|Apr 2016|<br />The fifth course of the Fundamentals of Computing Specialization. It starts to focus on Big O, and covers algorithms such as BFS, DFS. Much more challenging than the previous four, yet very much enjoyable.<br /> |
[Machine Learning: Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification)|Machine Learning|May 2016|<br />The third course of the Machine Learning Specialization by UW. It coveres practical cases and algorithms details of classification algorithms including logistic regression, decision tree, AdaBoost tree, etc.<br /> |
[Algorithmatic Thinking (Part 2)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-thinking-2)|Computer Science|May 2016|<br />The last course of the Fundamentals of Computing Specialization! (I did it!!!) This incldes three big projects, one on clustering algorithm, one on DP algorithm, and another on genomics text analytics. The best specialization ever!<br /> |
[Introduction to Probability and Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-intro)|Data Analytics|May 2016|<br />The first course of the Statistics with R Specialization by Duke University. Introduces some basic R (mainly dplyr package and ggplot2) and basic probability and statistics.<br /> |
[Inferential Statistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistics-intro)|Data Analytics|June 2016|<br />The second course of the Statistics with R Specialization by Duke University. This course focuses more on hypothesis testing. Very good professor and clear lectures.<br /> |
[Linear Regression and Modeling](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-regression-model)|Data Analytics|June 2016|<br />The third course of the Statistics with R Specialization by Duke University. This course focuses on linear regression. Very good professor and clear lectures and practical final project.<br /> |
[Bayesian Statistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian)|Data Analytics|Aug 2016|<br />The last course of the Statistics with R Specialization by Duke University. Different from the previous courses, this one is from the Beyasian prospective. Overall, this is a great specialization to review statistics and learn some R.<br /> |
[Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval)|Machine Learning|May 2016|<br />The last course of the Machine Learning Specialization by UW. It covers similarity calculation, TF-IDF, LDA, etc. Again, this is a great specialization with a lot of real-world examples and coding exercies (althrough it's not using a very popular machine learning package in Python).<br /> |
[Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)|Machine Learning|Jan 2017|<br />The very famous machie learning course by Andrew Ng. Definitely great course and great professor. It covers common machine learning algorithms in detail.<br /> |
