I’m a data scientist student at Columbia University. Physics, climate, energy enthusiast. I am currently doing

Outside of work, I’ve created a new data visualization every week since 2018 (~400 and counting!). I’m also passionate about the intersection of AI and data science, and regularly share practical applications and ideas on Medium and Towards Data Science. I’m passionate about applying data science and machine learning to real world problems. My work combines statistical modeling, causal inference, and machine learning. Much of what I’ve learned has come through experimentation and iteration; I often revisit old projects to refine and extend them. I believe in evolving continuously, after all, “all models are wrong, but some are useful.” —
