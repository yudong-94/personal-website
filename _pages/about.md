I’m a data scientist with 8 years of experience driving product growth through behavioral analysis, experimentation, causal inference, and machine learning. I stepped into management last year, owning key metrics, building scalable data systems, and shaping strategy through deep analysis.

Outside of work, I’ve created a new data visualization every week since 2018 (~400 and counting!). I’m also passionate about the intersection of AI and data science, and regularly share practical applications and ideas on Medium and Towards Data Science.
